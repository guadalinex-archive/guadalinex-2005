 <title>Preparing Files for USB Memory Stick Booting</title>

<para>

For preparing the USB stick you will need a system where GNU/Linux is
already running and where USB is supported. You should ensure that the
usb-storage kernel module is loaded (<userinput>modprobe
usb-storage</userinput>) and try to find out which SCSI device the USB
stick has been mapped to (in this example
<filename>/dev/sda</filename> is used). To write to your stick, you
will probably have to turn off its write protection switch.

</para><para>

Note that the USB stick should be at least 8 MB in size. If you follow
<xref linkend="usb-copy-flexible"/> and want to include an Ubuntu ISO
image on the stick, you will need enough space for the ISO as well.

</para>

There is an all-in-one file <ulink url="&url-ubuntu-installer;/images/netboot/boot.img.gz">netboot/boot.img.gz</ulink>
which contains all the installer files (including the kernel) as well
as <command>SYSLINUX</command> and its configuration file. You only
have to extract it directly to a partition on your USB stick:

<informalexample><screen>
# zcat boot.img.gz &gt; /dev/<replaceable>sda1</replaceable>
</screen></informalexample>

Of course this will destroy anything already on the device, so take
care that you use the correct device name for your USB stick.

  <title>Copying the files &mdash; the flexible way</title>
<para>

If you like more flexibility or just want to know what's going on, you
should use the following method to put the files on your stick.

   <title>Adding an ISO image</title>
<para>

If you are using the <filename>hd-media</filename> image, you should
now put any Ubuntu ISO image onto your stick (if it fits).
The file name of such an
image must end in <filename>.iso</filename>.

</para><para>

If you want to install over the network, without using an ISO image,
you will of course skip the previous step. Moreover you will have to
use the initial ramdisk from the <filename>netboot</filename>
directory instead of the one from <filename>hd-media</filename>,
because <filename>hd-media/initrd.gz</filename> does not have network
support.

</para><para>

When you are done, unmount the USB memory stick (<userinput>umount
/mnt</userinput>) and activate its write protection switch.

   <title>Booting the USB stick</title>
<warning><para>

If your system refuses to boot from the memory stick, the stick may
contain an invalid master boot record (MBR). To fix this, use the
<command>install-mbr</command> command from the package
<classname>mbr</classname>:

<informalexample><screen>
# install-mbr /dev/<replaceable>sda</replaceable>
