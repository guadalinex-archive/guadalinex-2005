This directory contains the mtPaint man page.

Users of mtPaint should not need to edit or make anything here - just use the configure script as normal.

Package maintainers may wish to put their details into the man page for their users.  Put these lines near the end of mtpaint.pod, just before the '=cut' at the end:

=head1 MAINTAINER

Your Name E<lt>your.name@email.addressE<gt>


Then from the command line:

./configure pod ...
make

etc.
