Description: The Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide
 An in-depth exploration of the art of shell scripting.
 .
 This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or
 programming, but progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced
 level of instruction ... all the while sneaking in little snippets
 of UNIX(R) wisdom and lore. It serves as a textbook, a manual for
 self-study, and a reference and source of knowledge on shell
 scripting techniques. The exercises and heavily-commented examples
 invite active reader participation, under the premise that the only
 way to really learn scripting is to write scripts.
 .
 This book is suitable for classroom use as a general introduction to
 programming concepts.

 AcidRip is a Gtk::Perl application for ripping and encoding DVD's. It

 MPlayer is by far the best bit of video playing kit around for Linux. As
 well as creating a simple Graphical Interface for those scared of getting
 down and dirty with MEncoders command line interface, It also automates the
 process in a number of ways:

Description: A single-player, text-based, dungeon simulation game.
 Angband is a single-player, text-based, dungeon simulation derived
 from the game Moria, which was in turn based on Rogue. It is
 often described as a "roguelike" game because the look and feel of
 the game is still quite similar to Rogue.
 .
 Angband features many enhancements over Moria: unique foes, artifacts,
 monster pits and vaults to name a few. Many of these new creatures
 and objects are drawn from the writings of J.R.R Tolkien, although
 some of the monsters come straight from classical mythology, Dungeons
 & Dragons, Rolemaster, or the minds of the original Angband coders.
 .
 The ultimate goal of the game is to develop a character strong enough
 to defeat Morgoth, who resides on dungeon level 100. Upon doing so,
 you will receive the exalted status of "winner" and your character may
 retire.
 .
 Angband is a reference to Morgoth's "prison of iron."
 .
 Morgoth was 'the Dark Enemy of Middle-Earth' during its First Age. He
 was banished by the Valar (offspring of Eru, "god" of J.R.R.
 Tolkien's world) at the end of the First Age and thus never appears
 in The Lord of the Rings, set during the Third Age. Sauron, who does
 figure into those tales, was the most powerful of his servants. Read
 Tolkien's 'The Silmarillion' for more on the legends of Middle-Earth.

 This is a fully-functional 100% Apple ][ emulator for the Linux console.

 It is partly written in 386 (AT&T) assembler and partly in C. You can
 switch diskettes using a diskette database through an intuitive
 interface.  Furthermore, it is possible to trim the speed of the
 emulator and it runs in full speed (approximately) twice as fast as an
 standard Apple II+ on a 486DX-50.  It uses the svgalib's key scancodes
 and implements the undocumented 6502 instructions (required by at
 least two games: Bug Attack and MS Pacman).
 .
 Because the Apple ROMs are copyrighted, they are not included here.  You
 will have to make copies of them from your old Apple computer, or try to
 find them on the net.
 .
 Transferring your old Apple disks is a bit of work, but you can save
 yourself the trouble of digging up your old masters by seeing if some
 kind soul has already done the work for you at:
 .
    ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/images/
 .
 Remember, you can only use these ROMs and images _legally_ if you already
 own the original.  Have fun!   (Ahhh....  What memories!)

Description: [Biology] Global multiple nucleotide or peptide sequence alignment
 This program performs an alignment of multiple nucleotide or amino
 acid sequences. It recognizes the format of input sequences and whether
 the sequences are nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) or amino acid (proteins). The
 output format may be selected from in various formats for multiple alignments
 such as Phylip or FASTA. ClustalW is very well accepted. An alternative,
 particularly for fragmented sequences, may be
 T-Coffee (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/TCoffee.html),
 DIALIGN (http://www.gsf.de/biodv/dialign.html)
 or one of the other many algorithms as summarised on
 http://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/bcd/Curric/MulAli/welcome.html.
 .
 The output of ClustalW can be edited manually but preferably with an alignment
 editor like seaview or within its companion clustalx.
 When building a model from your alignment, this can be applied for improved
 database searches. The debian package hmmer creates such in form of an HMM.

Description: [Biology] MPI-distributed global sequence alignment with ClustalW
 ClustalW is a popular tool for multiple sequence alignment. The
 alignment is achieved via three steps: pairwise alignment,
 guide-tree generation and progressive alignment. ClustalW-MPI is an
 MPI implementation of ClustalW. Based on
 version 1.82 of the original ClustalW, both the pairwise
 and progressive alignments are parallelized with MPI, a
 popular message passing programming standard. The
 pairwise alignments can be easily parallelized since the many
 alignments are time independent on each other. However
 the progressive alignments are essentially not parallelizable
 because of the time dependencies between each alignment.
 .
 Here the recursive parallelism paradigm is applied to the linear space
 profile-profile alignment algorithm. This approach is more time
 efficient on computers with distributed memory architecture.
 Traditional approach that relies on precomputing the profile-profile
 score matrix has also been implemented. Results shown the latter is indeed
 more appropriate for shared memory multiprocessor computer.
 .
 ClustalX is suggested for its support for local realignments, seaview
 is a versatile editor of alignments.

Description: [Biology] GUI for clustalw
 GUI interface for the ClustalW multiple sequence alignment program. It
 provides an integrated environment for performing multiple sequence
 and profile alignments and analysing the results. The sequence alignment is
 displayed in a window on the screen. A versatile coloring scheme has been
 incorporated allowing you to highlight conserved features  in the alignment.
 The pull-down menus at the top of the window allow you to select all the
 options required for traditional multiple sequence and profile alignment.
 .
 You can cut-and-paste sequences to change the order of the alignment; you can
 select a subset of sequences to be aligned; you can select a sub-range of the
 alignment to be realigned and inserted back into the original alignment.
 .
 Alignment quality analysis can be performed and low-scoring segments or
 exceptional residues can be highlighted.

 functionality.  The idea is that conserver will log all your serial
 traffic so you can go back and review why something crashed, look
 at changes (if done on the console), or tie the console logs into a
 monitoring system (just watch the logfiles it creates).  With
 multi-user capabilities you can work on equipment with others,

 that, assuming you have a network connection, you can interact with
 any of the equipment from home or wherever.

 .
 daemontools is a collection of tools for managing UNIX services.
 .
 supervise monitors a service. It starts the service and restarts the service if it dies. Setting up a new service is easy: all supervise needs is a directory with a run script that runs the service.
 .
 multilog saves error messages to one or more logs. It optionally timestamps each line and, for each log, includes or excludes lines matching specified patterns. It automatically rotates logs to limit the amount of disk space used.  If the disk fills up, it pauses and tries again, without losing any data.
 .
 svscan starts one supervise process for each subdirectory of the current directory, up to a limit of 1000 subdirectories. svscan skips subdirectory names starting with dots. supervise must be in svscan's path.
 .
 If a subdirectory sub is sticky, svscan starts a pair of supervise processes, one for sub, one for sub/log, with a pipe between them.  svscan needs two free descriptors for each pipe.

Description: Linux HOWTOs in HTML format (non-free)
 The doc-linux-nonfree-html package provides the non-free portion of the
 current Linux HOWTOs in HTML format. Alternatively, ASCII versions are
 provided in the doc-linux-nonfree-text package.
 .
 The version number reflects the month in which doc-linux-nonfree-html was
 created.
 .
 All files are available at http://www.tldp.org/ (with versions in ASCII,
 DVI, HTML, postscript, and SGML).
 .
 The documents in this package fail to meet the Debian Free Software
 Guidelines for various reasons. For the most part this is due to
 significant restrictions on modification or on commercial redistribution,
 neither of which can be allowed for packages in the main distribution. See
 /usr/share/doc/doc-linux-nonfree-html/copyright for full details.

 Doom Legacy is a 3d shoot'em'up game which can be played between
 32 players over TCP/IP. It features a lot of improvements over
 the old (commercial) Doom game.

 To play you need some maps, called "WAD"-files, the shareware version
 of doom is included in the doom-wad-shareware package (non-free
 section). You can use any other DOOM WADs as well.
 .
 This package provides additional data files necessary to run the
 doomlegacy game. However it does not provide a main WAD-file.

Description: tools to create dvd slideshow with menus
 dvd-slideshow
 This is the main script. It generates a DVD-compatible MPEG2 video file
 with audio from a text file input listing of pictures and effects.
 .
 dvd-menu
 Creates a simple DVD menu with buttons that link to MPEG2 files generated
 with dvd-slideshow or ones that you have created yourself.
 .
 gallery2slideshow
 Instead of a GUI to create slideshows, I already have almost everything set
 up from my web page that uses the Gallery program. I figured it wouldn't be
 that hard to just get a listing of all the images in a given album
 (sub-albums not supported!) and to generate an appropriate input file to
 dvd-slideshow.
 .
 jigl2slideshow
 Does the same thing as gallery2slideshow, but works on a jigl gallery

 GTK+/Gnome Application Development is an intermediate-to-advanced
 GTK+/Gnome programming book. You should be comfortable with programming
 (data structures, algorithms, etc.) and with the C programming language
 before you try to read it. It's also helpful to have had some
 introductory exposure to GTK+, via the online tutorial or Eric Harlow's
 book Developing Linux Applications with GTK+ and GDK.
 However, if you know C and are willing to jump right in you could start
 with this book, perhaps in conjunction with the GTK+ reference
 documentation.

 Exult is an open source engine for playing Ultima VII on a variety of

 Forge of Virtue) and Serpent Isle (plus Silver Seed) are both playable
 to the end.  Some differences to the original games exist; see sections
 5.3/5.4 of the FAQ.

 While it is possible to use the engine for other games, no such game has
 been written yet. Therefore, Exult is useless unless you own a copy of one

 on non-PostScript printers. Supported printers include common
 dot-matrix, inkjet and laser models.
 .
 Package gsfonts contains a set of standard fonts for Ghostscript.

 All registered games will be deleted when removing this package, just as if
 they were a part of it.
 .
 You need to have libwww-perl installed if you want the script to download
 the games and index itself.
 .
 To actually play the games you need a package providing a zcode interpreter.

Description: source for the ipw2100 driver
 This package provides the source code for the ipw2100 kernel modules.
 Intel PRO/Wireless 2100 (IPW2100) mini PCI adapter is a common component
 of Centrino notebooks.
 .
 In order to compile these modules you need the kernel sources (or the
 kernel-headers for the kernel-image packages from Debian). For compile
 instructions look into /usr/share/doc/ipw2100-source/README.Debian or
 simply use the module-assistant utility.
 .
 The project's homepage can be found here:

Description: Internetwork Routing Protocol Attack Suite
 Despite the "exciting" title this is merely a collection of programs
 used for advanced network operations, testing, and debugging.
 .
 CDP and the route injectors can be useful in a production network.
 Several other tools are useful for security and firewall testing.
 Finally some tools such as netenum are useful for general admin
 scripting.
 .
 Like all powerful tools, someone whom is terminally stupid could
 cause great damage when using these tools, so be careful.
 .
 cdp - Cisco discovery protocol packet sender
 igrp - IGRP route injector
 ass - Autonomous system scanner
 irdp - IRDP sender
 irdpresponder - IRDP responder
 itrace - ICMP based traceroute
 tctrace - TCP SYN based traceroute
 protos - ICMP based port scanner
 netmask - Asks for netmask via ICMP
 file2cable - Dumps any binary file direct to ethernet
 dfkaa - Troubleshoot devices formerly known as Ascend (Pipeline, etc)
 netenum - Ping scanner designed for shell scripts
 hsrp - HSRP failover tester
 icmp_redirect - ICMP redirection system
 timestamp - ICMP timestamp requester
 dhcpx - DHCP server "exerciser"
 .
 I placed this program  in "non-free" because per the license:
 1) A developer is required to get written permission to use code
    from IRPAS in derivative works
 2) Users are barred from using this software for illegal purposes

Description: LaTeX to HTML translator
 LaTeX2HTML is a conversion tool that that converts documents written
 in LaTeX to HTML format. In addition, it offers an easy migration
 path towards authoring complex hypermedia documents using familiar
 word-processing concepts.
 .
 LaTeX2HTML replicates the basic structure of a LaTeX document as a
 set of interconnected HTML files which can be explored using
 automatically generated navigation panels. The cross-references,
 citations, footnotes, the table of contents and the lists of figures
 and tables, are also translated into hypertext links. Formatting
 information which has equivalent ``tags'' in HTML (lists, quotes,
 paragraph breaks, type styles, etc.) is also converted
 appropriately. The remaining heavily formatted items such as
 mathematical equations, pictures or tables are converted to images
 which are placed automatically at the correct positions in the final
 HTML document.
 .
 LaTeX2HTML extends LaTeX by supporting arbitrary hypertext links and
 symbolic cross-references between evolving remote documents. It also
 allows the specification of conditional text and the inclusion of raw
 HTML commands. These hypermedia extensions to LaTeX are available as
 new commands and environments from within a LaTeX document.
 .
 Pstoimg, the part of latex2html that produces bitmap images from the
 LaTeX source, can support both GIF and PNG format.

Description: A pretty printer for various programming languages
 LGrind is a pretty printer for a large number of programming languages
 using LaTeX. It is in the form of a separate preprocessor.
 .
 The licence is non-free, as it contains a no-sale clause.
 You might consider using the listings package instead, which is free;
 it also claims to be able to read the language definitions of LGrind.
 LGrind's output tends to be prettier, though, especially if you prefer
 non-monospaced fonts.

 DScaler is a Win32 application that captures video, processes it, and
 scales it for presentation.  It implements highly sophisticated
 algorithms that work in real-time, for high-quality video images.
 .
 The libdscaler package contains Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) from the
 DScaler application.  They are able to:
  * Deinterlace video source, from both cameras and console games;
  * Detect and remove 2:2 pulldown (PAL) and 3:2 pulldown (NTSC) for
    movies and filmed television programs;
  * Reduce video noise on analog sources; and
  * Reduce jitter and other video timing anomalies.
 .
 Currently, these libraries are used as plugins by the tvtime package,
 dynamically loaded using Wine.

Description: Graph Editing Framework written entirely in Java
 This lib is needed by ArgoUML but can be used within different applications.

 The goal of the GEF project is to build a graph editing library that can be
 used to construct many, high-quality graph editing appications. Some of GEF's
 features are:
  * A simple, concrete design that makes the framework easy to understand and
    extend.
  * Node-Port-Edge graph model that is powerful enough for the vast majority
   of connectied graph applications.
  * Model-View-Controller design based on the Swing Java UI library makes GEF
   able to act as a UI to existing data structures, and also minimizing learning
   time for developers familiar with Swing.
  * High-quality user interactions for moving, resizeing, reshaping, etc. GEF
   also supports several novel interactions such as the broom alignment tool
   and secltion-action-buttons.
  * Generic properties sheet based on JavaBeans introspection.
  * XML-based file formats based on the PGML standard (soon to support SVG).

Description: MJPEG video capture/editting/playback MPEG encoding
 The mjpeg programs are a set of tools that can do recording of videos and
 playback, simple cut-and-paste editing and the MPEG compression of audio
 and video under Linux. This package combines them with important supporting
 libraries required for their use.
 .
 The "lavrec" utility supplied supports capture from Zoran based MJPEG
 capture/playback cards like the Buz (Iomega), DC10 (MIRO, Pinnacle) and the
 LML33 (Linux Media Labs). Compatible MJPEG avi files can also be created
 using any frame-grabbing card supported by the xawtv tool.
 .
 Videos recorded in this can be filtered, editted, and converted to MPEG
 streams. The MPEG encoder is optimised for high quality results at medium
 to high bit-rates (1Mbps upwards) and supports MMX/SSE/3D-Now and SMP. A
 Duron 700 can deliver around 15-20 352x288 frames per second.
 .
 A key design objective of the tools is interoperability with other video
 tools: currently xawtv, bcast2000, nuppelvideo and vcdimager are known to
 interoperate. The MJPEG utilities can read AVI, Quicktime, and movtar
 streams. The MPEG encoder can produce streams suitable for buring to
 VCD/SVCD using vcdimager or similar tools. The software playback of MPEG
 streams works with almost every player and every OS. SSE/MMX and 3D-Now!
 are supported permitting a 700Mhz CPU to deliver arond 15-20 VCD
 frames/second.

 encourages application architectures based on the Model 2 approach, a
 variation of the classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm.
 .
 Struts provides its own Controller component and integrates with other
 technologies to provide the Model and the View. For the Model, Struts can
 interact with any standard data access technology, including Enterprise Java
 Beans (EJB), JDBC, and Object Relational Bridge. For the View, Struts works
 well with JavaServer Pages (JSP), including JSTL and JSF, as well as Velocity
 Templates, XSLT, and other presentation systems.

 .
 Note that this is a *library*, so you have to get interface programs using
 libtrain(gtktrain is recommended) to actually use it.
 .
 To use this software, you'll need to get the train schedule data separately
 and install it by yourself.  See README.Debian for more detail.
 .
 This package contains the shared library and configuration files
 needed to run programs using libtrain.

Description: Intel IA32 CPU Microcode Utility
 The microcode_ctl utility is a companion to the IA32 microcode driver
 written by Tigran Aivazian <tigran@veritas.com>. The utility has two
 uses:
 .
 a) it decodes and sends new microcode to the kernel driver to be
    uploaded to Intel IA32 family processors. (Pentium Pro, PII,
    Celeron, PIII, Xeon, Pentium 4, etc.) and the Intel x86_64
    family processors
 b) it signals the kernel driver to release any buffers it may hold
 .
 The microcode update is volatile and needs to be uploaded on each
 system boot i.e. it doesn't re-flash your CPU permanently, reboot and
 it reverts back to the old microcode. The ideal place to load
 microcode is in BIOS, but most vendors never update it!
 .
 To enable microcode update, I need some kernel support, thus I need
 the linux kernel 2.2.18 or later, or 2.4.0 or later.

Description: MJPEG video capture/editting/playback MPEG encoding
 The mjpeg programs are a set of tools that can do recording of videos and
 playback, simple cut-and-paste editing and the MPEG compression of audio
 and video under Linux. This package combines them with important supporting
 libraries required for their use.
 .
 The "lavrec" utility supplied supports capture from Zoran based MJPEG
 capture/playback cards like the Buz (Iomega), DC10 (MIRO, Pinnacle) and the
 LML33 (Linux Media Labs). Compatible MJPEG avi files can also be created
 using any frame-grabbing card supported by the xawtv tool.
 .
 Videos recorded in this can be filtered, editted, and converted to MPEG
 streams. The MPEG encoder is optimised for high quality results at medium
 to high bit-rates (1Mbps upwards) and supports MMX/SSE/3D-Now and SMP. A
 Duron 700 can deliver around 15-20 352x288 frames per second.
 .
 A key design objective of the tools is interoperability with other video
 tools: currently xawtv, bcast2000, nuppelvideo and vcdimager are known to
 interoperate. The MJPEG utilities can read AVI, Quicktime, and movtar
 streams. The MPEG encoder can produce streams suitable for buring to
 VCD/SVCD using vcdimager or similar tools. The software playback of MPEG
 streams works with almost every player and every OS. SSE/MMX and 3D-Now!
 are supported permitting a 700Mhz CPU to deliver arond 15-20 VCD
 frames/second.

Description: A roguelike game with an infinite dungeon
 NOTE: despite the package name, this is actually UMORIA 5.5.2.
 .
 A single player roguelike game with a regenerating dungeon, moria is the
 predecessor of angband with a full-screen, text-based, turn-based
 interface.  It features scrolling maps, and an infinite (constantly
 regenerated) dungeon.
 .
 Moria's dungeons are populated by monsters, some of which are inspired by
 J.R.R. Tolkien's books.  The goal of the game is to find and kill the
 Balrog, whereupon the player is crowned King.  Your player can be created
 from a combination of 8 races (human, half-elf, elf, halfling, gnome,
 dwarf, half-orc, half-troll) and 6 classes (warrior, mage, priest, rogue,
 ranger, paladin), and is measured by 6 attributes (strength, dexterity,
 intelligence, wisdom, constitution, and charisma).

Description: The Ultimate Movie Player For Linux
 It plays most mpeg, avi and asf files, supported by many native and win32
 DLL codecs. You can watch VCD, DVD and even DivX movies too. The other
 big feature of mplayer is the wide range of supported output drivers. It
 works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, but you can use SDL (and
 this way all drivers of SDL) and some lowlevel card-specific drivers (for
 Matrox/3dfx/SiS) too! Most of them supports software or hardware scaling,
 so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen.
 .
 This version is for all CPUs.

Description: The Ultimate Movie Player For Linux
 It plays most mpeg, avi and asf files, supported by many native and win32
 DLL codecs. You can watch VCD, DVD and even DivX movies too. The other
 big feature of mplayer is the wide range of supported output drivers. It
 works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, but you can use SDL (and
 this way all drivers of SDL) and some lowlevel card-specific drivers (for
 Matrox/3dfx/SiS) too! Most of them supports software or hardware scaling,
 so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen.

Description: Mwave/ACP modem support software
 The Mwave modem support software implements a Hayes-compatible
 V.90 modem in the 3780i Mwave/ACP DSP chip which is built in
 to several discontinued IBM ThinkPad laptop computers,
 including the ThinkPad 600, 600E and 770 models.
 .
 In addition to the programs included in this package, a driver
 is required for the Mwave device. Source code for the driver,
 built as a module called 'mwave.o' or 'mwave.ko', is included
 in the latest 2.4 and 2.6 Linux kernel sources. To build the
 module, set "ACP/Mwave Modem support" to "m" at kernel
 configuration time. This module must be loaded before the
 Mwavem modem support program can be started.
 .
 This package is in the non-free section of the archive
 because it contains program binaries for the 3780i chip
 that have been furnished by IBM without source code.

 This is OpusTeX beta-test Version 0.84 (February 1998).  This package
 contains the OpusTeX macros, musixflex, OpusTeX User's Manual in LaTeX
 source and DVI formats, and example source OpusTeX music score files.
 .
 OpusTeX is a set of versatile and power TeX macros to typeset polyphonic,
 orchestral or choral music.  It allows very fine control and produces
 professional printed music scores.
 .
 OpusTeX is still a beta-test Version and only dedicated for those, who
 want to work with and--more important--to work on.
 .
 Due to the important amount of information to be provided to the
 typesetting process, coding OpusTeX might appear to be awfully
 complicated, especially for beginners.  Therefore, it is recommended
 to use OpusTeX with some pre-processors such as ABC2MTeX.
 Visit the GMD Music Archive at http://www.gmd.de/Misc/Music/ and check
 the MuTeX Mailing List Archive for more information.

 pdp8 emulator such as Jones's or Haygood's emulator.
 .
 The os8 script will run the simh emulator
 with these images.
 .
 These images are not DFSG free because DEC prohibits
 commercial use of these images.

Description: primal-dual interior-point code for linear programming
 PCx is a freely available primal-dual interior-point code for linear
 programming. It implements Mehrotra's predictor-corrector algorithm,
 the algorithm that forms the basis of most existing interior-point
 codes for general linear programming. The major computational
 operation--solution of a linear system with a large, sparse positive
 definite coefficient matrix--is performed with the sparse Cholesky
 package of Ng and Peyton (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), with minor
 modifications to handle small pivot elements.  PCx does not solve
 integer programming problems.  For more information, see

Description: Persistence of vision raytracer (3D renderer)
 POV-Ray is a full-featured ray tracer. Ray tracers simulate objects
 and light sources of the real world to calculate photorealistic, computer
 generated images. Because of the nature of ray tracing, this process is
 quite CPU-intensive, at the benefit of more realistic images compared to
 real time rendering techniques. For example, in POV-Ray, you can model a
 glass prism, and you will see a spectrum in the resulting image.
 .
 This version of POV-Ray supports distributed rendering by means of PVM.
 .
 POV-Ray by itself is a command-line utility that will take scene
 descriptions, written in a special easy-to-understand language, to
 produce ray-traced images (or even a sequence of images, for animations).
 You can either write those scene-descriptions by hand, or use external
 tools to generate (parts of) the scene.
 .
 povray-3.5-includes is highly recommended in addition to this package.

Description: qmail mrtg graph generator
 qmailmrtg7 uses qmail's excellent and extensive logging via multilog,
 tcpserver and qmail-send. qmailmrtg7 takes the pop3 smtp and qmail
 transaction logs and sends them to 9 different mrtg graphs, each graph
 with 4 historical time series.
 .
 Features:
  - very fast - typically processes in less than 2 seconds
  - intelligently uses the multilog file name time stamp to determine which
    logs to open and process
  - single small C program with no external dependencies and simple command
    line options.
  - works on any system that supports qmail

 guidelines are followed exactly, it is hoped that the TeX
 manuscript file (called a compuscript) can be used by APS, OSA,
 AIP, and other participating member societies in production of
 author proofs. This package is now obsolete, REVTeX 4, provided by
 the package tetex-extra should be used instead. This package is kept
 in order to provide backward compatibility (for older documents
 prepared with REVTeX 3.1 rather than REVTeX 4).

Description: control mobile robots in this programmer's game
 Before the game starts, each player writes an assembler-like program
 which has to decide for itself later on, in order to win the game.
 The pieces on the chess-like field are robots, which have the
 abilities to move, multiply, exchange program code etc. The goal is
 to put the other players' robots out of action while staying
 functional yourself.
 .
 RoboCom is not a military game! There is nothing like weapons: the
 only way to influence another robot is to transfer program code. And
 that makes it particularly interesting. The programming language is
 easy to learn, however it provides an amazingly wide spectrum of
 different strategies, which are all successful in another way.

 It is a true hard RTOS. The whole Linux system (kernel and user processes)

 Since RTLinux is POSIX-compatible, most of the man pages are taken from the
 SUSV (The Single UNIX Specification, www.opengroup.org). That documentation
 can be downloaded but not redistributed. Therefore, it is not
 included in the package, but an installer is supplied.

Description: SETI@Home Client (install package)
 SETI@home is a scientific experiment that harnesses the power of
 hundreds of thousands of Internet-connected computers in the Search
 for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI).  You can participate by
 running a free program that downloads and analyzes radio telescope
 data. There's a small but captivating possibility that your computer
 will detect the faint murmur of a civilization beyond Earth.
 .
 SETI@Home is only distributed in binary form and the correct unix tar
 ball for your architecture has to be downloaded from
 http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/unix.html and placed in $TMPDIR
 (or /tmp if $TMPDIR is not defined).
 .
 This installer package will automagically wget the right tarball and
 install the program, if the target debian linux architecture is one
 of the following: x86, alpha, sparc, powerpc, hppa or ia64.

Description: The Stanford GraphBase: combinatorial data and algorithms
 A highly portable collection of programs and data for researchers who
 study combinatorial algorithms and data structures.
 .
 The programs are intended to be interesting in themselves as examples
 of literate programming.  Thus, the Stanford GraphBase can also be
 regarded as a collection of approximately 30 essays for programmers
 to enjoy reading, whether or not they are doing algorithmic research.
 The programs are written in CWEB, a combination of TeX and C that is
 easy to use by anyone who knows those languages and easy to read by
 anyone familiar with the rudiments of C.
 .
 This package contains only the libraries and the demonstration
 programs; for the readable source code, which forms the documentation
 as well, see the sgb-doc package.

 This package replaces (along with hardware access drivers) the old
 driver generation (2.7.x) which consisted of kernel modules only.
 .
 It needs a kernel driver to access the hardware. This can be either
 recent ALSA (shipped with a newer kernel (>=2.6.4) with Alsa support
 and intel8x0m module) which is sufficient for basic operation and
 data/Internet connection, or the SmartLink kernel driver which is
 provided by separate packages which you can build using the source from
 the sl-modem-source package.

 It emulates the Z80 processor as well as the 48k Spectrum's other

Description: A single-player, text-based, dungeon simulation game.
 Tome, short for Troubles of Middle Earth, is a single-player,
 text-based, dungeon simulation derived from the game angband, which
 in turn is derived from the older game Moria, which was in turn based
 on Rogue. It is often described as a "roguelike" game because the
 look and feel of the game is still quite similar to Rogue.
 .
 In tome, the  player may choose from a number of races and classes
 when creating a character, and then "run" that character over a
 period of days, weeks, even months, attempting to win the game by
 defeating Morgoth, who lurks somewhere in  the depths of the dungeon.
 .
 The ultimate goal of the game is to develop a character strong enough
 to defeat Morgoth, who resides on dungeon level 100. Upon doing so,
 you will receive the exalted status of "winner" and your character may
 retire.
 .
 The first main difference from Angband a new player to ToME will need
 to be aware of is that it has implemented a skills based system where
 instead of the  adventurer automatically improving in their abilities
 as they become more experienced, they get 5 skill points to spend on
 their character's abilities and can therefore customise what type of
 character they play. See the skills help file for details
 .
 The second major difference is that the main dungeon from Angband has
 been split  into 4 "dungeons", each of which cover a different
 portion of the dungeon's  levels. Note that not all of the places are
 actually "dungeons" - some are caves, forests, etc.
 .
 The third main difference between Vanilla Angband and ToME is the
 difference  in character classes and races, as well as a very
 different  magic system. ToME also offers the player the ability to
 undertake a series of  quests. It is not required for any adventurer
 to undertake  the fixed  quests, but they can result in some nice
 rewards.
 .
 Morgoth was 'the Dark Enemy of Middle-Earth' during its First Age. He
 was banished by the Valar (offspring of Eru, "god" of J.R.R.
 Tolkien's world) at the end of the First Age and thus never appears
 in The Lord of the Rings, set during the Third Age. Sauron, who does
 figure into those tales, was the most powerful of his servants. Read
 Tolkien's 'The Silmarillion' for more on the legends of Middle-Earth.
 Angband is a reference to Morgoth's "prison of iron."

Description: Threaded USENET news reader, based on rn (4.0 beta test)
 trn is a threaded news reader with a long history, descended from Larry
 Wall's rn (part of the second generation of newsreaders).  It has a
 powerful full screen text mode user interface, where most actions are
 available at the press of a single key.  It is highly configurable.
 .
 This version of trn reads news from a news server via NNTP (the Network
 News Transfer Protocol).  You must have a news server available - large
 sites usually provide a site-wide server.
 .
 If you install a news server on your system (either containing just
 local newsgroups or with a partial or full USENET feed) you can
 configure trn to access it.
 .
 This is a separate package from trn because trn 4.0 has enough
 substantial changes in its default behaviour (for instance, the group
 selector is new in 4.0) that some users prefer to stay with an older
 version of trn.

Description: Gentium TrueType font
 Gentium is a typeface family designed to enable the diverse ethnic
 groups around the world who use the Latin script to produce readable,
 high-quality publications. It supports a wide range of Latin-based
 alphabets and includes glyphs that correspond to all the Latin ranges of
 Unicode.
 .
 The design is intended to be highly readable, reasonably compact, and
 visually attractive.
 Diacritics are treated with careful thought and attention to their use.
 Gentium also supports both ancient and modern Greek, including a number
 of alternate forms. These fonts were originally the product of two years
 of research and study by the designer at the University of Reading,
 England, as part of an MA program in Typeface Design.
 .
 SIL International has now embraced the Gentium project, and plans to
 continue development. Expansion of the glyph set to include more
 extended Latin glyphs, archaic Greek symbols, and full Cyrillic script
 support is the next step. Work on this has already begun, but the
 results will not be available for a few months. Addition of bold and
 bold italic faces will follow.
 .
 Gentium is freely available and may be used by anyone at no cost. It is
 not public domain, and cannot be altered, but can be given to anyone
 who might need it. Our hope is that it will stimulate literature
 production and elevate extended Latin alphabets to greater parity with
 the basic Latin alphabet. We also hope it will encourage other type
 designers to appreciate and support those fascinating and beautiful
 extra letters.

 NOTE: For "proper" use of UAE, you need some version of the Kickstart

 and must be obtained from other sources. There is information in the
 package docs how to obtain these if you are owner of an Amiga box.

 However, there is a minimal free build-in Kickstart replacement, and
 at least some demo disks are reported to run with it.

Description: Java-based template engine for web application
 Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use
 the simple yet powerful template language to reference objects
 defined in Java code.
 When Velocity is used for web development, Web designers can work in
 parallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the
 Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers
 can focus solely on creating a site that looks good, and programmers
 can focus solely on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java
 code from the web pages, making the web site more maintainable over
 the long run and providing a viable alternative to Java Server Pages
 (JSPs) or PHP.

 This is a fully-functional 100% Apple ][ emulator for X windows.
 .
 It is partly written in 386 (AT&T) assembler and partly in C. You can
 switch diskettes using a diskette database through an intuitive
 interface.  Furthermore, it is possible to trim the speed of the
 emulator and it runs in full speed (approximately) twice as fast as an
 standard Apple II+ on a 486DX-50.  It uses the svgalib's key scancodes
 and implements the undocumented 6502 instructions (required by at
 least two games: Bug Attack and MS Pacman).
 .
 Because the Apple ROMs are copyrighted, they are not included here.  You
 will have to make copies of them from your old Apple computer, or try to
 find them on the net
 .
 Transferring your old Apple disks is a bit of work, but you can save
 yourself the trouble of digging up your old masters by seeing if some
 kind soul has already done the work for you at:
 .
    ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/images/
 .
 Remember, you can only use these ROMs and images _legally_ if you already
 own the original.  Have fun!   (Ahhh....  What memories!)

Description: emulator for TRS-80 Model I/III/4/4P computers
 xtrs is an X-based emulator for the Tandy/Radio Shack line of Zilog
 Z-80-based microcomputers popular in the late 1970's and early 1980's.  It
 features cassette, floppy, and hard drive emulation, timer interrupt
 emulation, file import and export from the host operating system, support for
 most of the undocumented Z-80 instructions, and a built-in debugger.  Real
 floppy drives can be used, and, if an OSS-compatible sound driver is
 available, application-based sound can be played and real cassettes read and
 written directly through the sound card or via WAVE files.  Several hi-res
 graphics cards are emulated and, in Model 4/4P mode, mice are supported.
 There is also real-time clock, sound card, serial port, joystick, and CPU
 clock speedup emulation.
 .
 xtrs requires ROM images from the original machines.  The ROMs are
