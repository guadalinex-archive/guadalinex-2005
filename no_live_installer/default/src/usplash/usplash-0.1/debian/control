Description: Userspace bootsplash utility
 Usplash is a userspace application that uses the Linux framebuffer interface
 to draw a splash screen at boot. It has a companion utility that is able to
 send commands to usplash, allowing information about the bootup sequence to
 be displayed in a more attractive way.
