archive-copier (0.3.5) breezy; urgency=low

  * Fix handling of multiple Task headers in a single package stanza.
  * Fix a memory leak on each package stanza containing a Task header.
  * Make -D/-S match Archive-Copier-Set headers (which cdimage will
    synthesise) as well as Task headers, so that we don't have to pollute
    user-visible Task headers with stuff that's just there to help
    archive-copier.

archive-copier (0.3.3) breezy; urgency=low

  * Expand on archive-copier/copy-failed text to explain that failures may
    be due to CD problems.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 19 Sep 2005 10:53:30 +0100

archive-copier (0.3.2) breezy; urgency=low

  * Add Portuguese translation (thanks, Hugo Monteiro).

archive-copier (0.3.1) breezy; urgency=low

  * Always copy dash as part of desktop, since discover1 depends on it.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri,  2 Sep 2005 11:17:49 +0100

archive-copier (0.3.0) breezy; urgency=low

  * Apply macrology to reduce code duplication.
  * Allow multiple -D/-S options to package-cache-names.
  * Copy language pack and language support tasks rather than individual
    packages, in order to follow dependencies. cdimage has been modified to
    generate appropriate Task headers.
  * Policy version 3.6.2. No changes required.
  * Update debian/copyright with the FSF's new address.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 31 Aug 2005 23:06:28 +0100

archive-copier (0.2.6) breezy; urgency=low

  * Copy language-pack-*-base as well as language-pack-*.
  * Copy desktop and ship if there is anything to copy for them, not just if
    the corresponding task name is defined.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Sun,  7 Aug 2005 21:25:18 +0100

archive-copier (0.2.5) breezy; urgency=low

  * Stop forcing mdetect into desktop; base-config no longer needs it.
  * Copy language-pack-gnome-$LL as well as language-pack-$LL by default.
  * Force libdiscover1 into desktop; discover1 depends on it.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Sat,  6 Aug 2005 12:56:24 +0100

archive-copier (0.2.4) breezy; urgency=low

  * Minor copyright file updates.
  * debootstrap 0.3 needs a mirror location even when doing --print-debs.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 28 Jun 2005 01:06:16 +0100

archive-copier (0.2.3) breezy; urgency=low

  * Force discover1 and discover1-data into desktop, since base-config
    installs them.
  * Copy any necessary language packs.
  * Don't bother scanning the CD if there aren't many files to copy (< 100).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 16 May 2005 23:27:42 +0100

archive-copier (0.2.2) breezy; urgency=low

  * Assign to DESKTOP and SHIP so that the desktop and ship tasks actually
    get copied.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 12 May 2005 11:08:05 +0100

archive-copier (0.2.1) breezy; urgency=low

  * Allow the desktop and ship tasks to be extended regular expressions.
  * Remove support for the obsolete ubuntu/install-type; instead, copy tasks
    if their task names are set.
  * Default to copying ubuntu-standard and ubuntu-desktop as the "desktop
    task".
  * Allow archive-copier/desktop-task and/or archive-copier/ship-task to be
    empty, so that server installations can copy only the standard seed.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 11 May 2005 13:58:31 +0100

archive-copier (0.2.0) breezy; urgency=low

  * Use options to package-cache-names rather than ordered arguments, to
    allow extensibility.
  * Add -d/-s package-cache-names options to add packages to desktop/ship,
    allowing the force_desktop hack to be implemented in debian/postinst
    instead of in C.
  * Copy language-support-* packages as required (closes: Ubuntu #8766).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 13 Apr 2005 14:32:00 +0100

archive-copier (0.1.5) hoary; urgency=low

  * Subtract "\n\n" length from *left, not left; fixes occasional segfault
    when reaching the end of the Packages file.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  7 Apr 2005 03:30:16 +0100

archive-copier (0.1.4) hoary; urgency=low

  * Update French translation (thanks, Sebastien Bacher).
  * Add Greek translation (thanks, Giorgos Logiotatidis).
  * Add Norwegian Bokmål translation (thanks, Terance Edward Sola).
  * Add Romanian translation (thanks, Ovidiu Damian).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed,  6 Apr 2005 00:36:38 +0100

archive-copier (0.1.3) hoary; urgency=low

  * Fix segfault when the Packages file size is an exact multiple of
    getpagesize(). get_paragraph() was relying on the mmap()ed Packages file
    being null-terminated, which in turn relied on mmap() zero-filling
    partial pages, and so failed when there were no partial pages. We now
    avoid relying on null-termination here.
  * Add Spanish translation (thanks, Enrique Matías Sánchez).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 29 Mar 2005 13:25:27 +0100

archive-copier (0.1.2) hoary; urgency=low

  * Update Brazilian Portuguese translation (thanks, Carlos Eduardo Pedroza
    Santiviago).
  * Update French translation (thanks, Sebastien Bacher).
  * Update German translation (thanks, Maximilian Gerlach).
  * Add Hungarian translation (thanks, Gabor Burjan).
  * Add Indonesian translation (thanks, Yoppy Hidayanto).
  * Add Polish translation (thanks, Dominik Zabłotny).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 28 Mar 2005 20:01:14 +0100

archive-copier (0.1.1) hoary; urgency=low

  * Add Brazilian Portuguese translation (thanks, Carlos Eduardo Pedroza
    Santiviago).
  * Add German translation (thanks, Herbert Straub).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Sat, 26 Mar 2005 01:08:59 +0000

archive-copier (0.1.0) hoary; urgency=low

  * After copying packages, check whether the required language-support
    packages are available; if not, ask whether to download them from the
    network. (This question is already preseeded in server installations, so
    won't be asked.)
  * Add French translation (thanks, Sebastien Bacher).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 25 Mar 2005 02:52:42 +0000

archive-copier (0.0.21) hoary; urgency=low

  * Add draft Xhosa translation.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 22 Mar 2005 14:29:07 +0000

archive-copier (0.0.20) hoary; urgency=low

  * Get name of desktop task from archive-copier/desktop-task rather than
    hardcoding ubuntu-desktop (for Kubuntu et al).
  * Use new ubuntu-ship task to find contents of ship, so that we don't copy
    all the packages on an install DVD.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 11 Mar 2005 20:02:12 +0000

archive-copier (0.0.19) hoary; urgency=low

  * Remove Release/Release.gpg hack, since apt-cdrom has now been fixed.
  * Stop running apt-cdrom altogether; apt-setup-udeb does that now.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 25 Feb 2005 15:06:37 +0000

archive-copier (0.0.18) hoary; urgency=low

  * Cope with apt-cdrom's slightly changed format for the "Stored Label:"
    line.
  * Stop progress bar if exiting early.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 11 Feb 2005 14:20:26 +0000

archive-copier (0.0.17) hoary; urgency=low

  * Renumber menu item to 68 to give myself slightly more room before
    bootloader installation.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 31 Jan 2005 18:18:04 +0000

archive-copier (0.0.16) hoary; urgency=low

  * Merge prebaseconfig script into postinst. We don't run before
    base-installer any more, so there's no need for the separation, and
    running apt-cdrom earlier allows apt-setup to be slotted in more
    conveniently before the first reboot.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 31 Jan 2005 14:47:32 +0000

archive-copier (0.0.15) hoary; urgency=low

  * It turns out that apt-cdrom doesn't yet copy Release and Release.gpg
    files around in such a way as to ensure that apt believes that the
    packages in the cache have been authenticated. To work around this bug
    for now, verify the signature and move Release and Release.gpg by hand
    into the place where apt expects to find them. (This is awful, and
    apt-cdrom should be fixed before Hoary rather than allowing this code to
    remain.)

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 19 Jan 2005 23:12:54 +0000

archive-copier (0.0.14) hoary; urgency=low

  * Switch maintainer address to @ubuntu.com.
  * Raise priority to standard, so that archive-copier doesn't have to go in
    udeb_include on the CD any more. This was causing problems for combined
    install/live DVDs.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 18 Jan 2005 13:49:27 +0000

archive-copier (0.0.13) hoary; urgency=low

  * Go back to sorting by filename rather than package name, in order to get
    better seek time performance.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@canonical.com>  Tue,  4 Jan 2005 18:39:57 +0000

archive-copier (0.0.12) hoary; urgency=low

  * Run find over pool directories on the CD, to get all the directories
    into the dentry cache and cut down on seek times. (cdrom-detect does
    this too, but apparently the directories have generally been driven out
    of cache by the time archive-copier runs.)

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@canonical.com>  Tue,  4 Jan 2005 18:23:08 +0000

archive-copier (0.0.11) hoary; urgency=low

  * Put working files in /var/spool/archive-copier/ rather than /tmp.
  * Calculate the length of the progress bar after working out which
    packages to copy.
  * Copy packages sorted by package name, which looks better.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@canonical.com>  Fri, 17 Dec 2004 14:17:42 +0100

archive-copier (0.0.10) hoary; urgency=low

  * Look at all components listed by the CD as installable.
  * Consider linux-image-* as part of base so that it doesn't get copied.
    (This isn't complete due to linux-386 etc., but it gets rid of most of
    the space wastage.)

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@canonical.com>  Wed,  8 Dec 2004 20:04:28 +0100

archive-copier (0.0.9) warty; urgency=low

  * Move Desktop cache to /var/cache/archive-copier/desktop.
  * Copy Ship to /var/cache/archive-copier/ship.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@canonical.com>  Tue, 19 Oct 2004 00:02:10 +0100

archive-copier (0.0.8) warty; urgency=low

  * Always treat laptop-detect, mdetect, and xresprobe as though they were
    in Desktop. base-config needs them.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@canonical.com>  Wed,  6 Oct 2004 23:08:24 +0100

archive-copier (0.0.7) warty; urgency=low

  * Don't copy Supported; we need more integration work for that to be
    useful.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@canonical.com>  Wed, 29 Sep 2004 20:30:50 +0100

archive-copier (0.0.6) warty; urgency=low

  * Only copy Desktop and Supported in normal mode, and nothing in custom
    mode. debootstrap runs quickly enough nowadays that it doesn't need
    help.
  * Move to after base-installer has finished.
  * Adjust templates to read "Copying remaining packages to hard disk", etc.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@canonical.com>  Thu,  9 Sep 2004 16:44:05 +0100

archive-copier (0.0.5) warty; urgency=low

  * Fix base-system-only copying in custom mode (closes: Warty #1093).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@canonical.com>  Wed,  8 Sep 2004 12:12:34 +0100

archive-copier (0.0.4) warty; urgency=low

  * Fix retrieval of answer to archive-copier/copy.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@canonical.com>  Wed,  8 Sep 2004 00:13:42 +0100

archive-copier (0.0.3) warty; urgency=low

  * Add prebaseconfig script to run 'apt-cdrom add' if packages were copied.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@canonical.com>  Tue,  7 Sep 2004 18:55:29 +0100

archive-copier (0.0.2) warty; urgency=low

  * Copy non-base packages into /var/cache/archive-copier rather than
    /var/cache/apt/archives. base-config will deal with moving them into the
    right place once it's cleaned base packages out of the cache.
  * Don't copy non-base packages in the custom install mode.
  * Expand progress bar title to "Copying packages to hard disk".

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@canonical.com>  Fri,  3 Sep 2004 22:33:16 +0100

archive-copier (0.0.1) warty; urgency=low
