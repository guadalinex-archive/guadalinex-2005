The base-config package can be removed from your system. It was used to ask
you some questions when you freshly installed debian and booted it up for
the first time, and is no longer needed.

If you'd like to be asked those questions again, you can; just run
'base-config'. You might also prefer to just run 'apt-setup' to revisit the
apt setup portion.

A transcript of base-config runs can be found in /var/log/base-config.log.
