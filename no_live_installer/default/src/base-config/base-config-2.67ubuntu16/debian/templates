 security updates from the internet.

 you want to use it during the install, you may configure the PPP

Template: base-config/install-problem
Type: note
Default: true
_Description: There was a problem installing the selected software
 One or more packages failed to install. This may be due to bugs in
 the packages, or you may be out of disk space or experiencing some other
 problem.
 .
 Simply trying to install those packages (or a slightly different set of
 packages) again may work around the problem, or at least move the
 installation process along a little further. If you want, you can go back
 to the package selection step, and try again.
 .
 If you decide not to try again, bear in mind that some packages on your
 system will be in a broken state until you manually resolve the problem.
