* TODO items in code.
* if apt-setup fails an apt-get update run, should offer to retry as well
  as the two choices it gives now, since it might be intermittent network
  problems
* It might be useful to extend the environment variable stuff to setting of
  debconf questions. The idea being that you could then set a few at the
  lilo command line, set the frontend to noninteractive and walk away while
  it installs.
* map between cdebconf frontends and debconf frontend, so you can start
  with "text" and end with "readline". It may be better really to put this
  mapping in debconf, or wait until cdebconf replaces debconf on the second
  stage.
* The problem with the unseen-only stuff and dpkg-reconfigure is that
  if a user is using base-config in a new install at medium priority, they
  can select a menu item multiple times, and it should work each time.
  How to reconcile this with pre-seeding?
* Replace the mirror selection part of apt-setup with choose-mirror from
  d-i. Waiting on a deb, which is waiting on the archive being changed to
  allow debs with the same name as udebs.
* Enable job control in the shell from the menu.
* If a menu item that is next goes away during a menu item run, the code
  to advance menu items gets confused, and puts the cursor somewhere
  random.
* Stop using debconf-copydb, and use the preseeding mechanism to copy all
  needed values from the d-i database. This will require moving preseeding
  off of the menu, and into base-config startup. See joeyh's comments in bug
  #279590 for some rationalle for why this would be a good idea.
* Display message when preseeded early or late command fails, and let the
  user retry (in case it hitds network) or abort.
