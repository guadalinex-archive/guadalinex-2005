GParted stands for Gnome Partition Editor.

It uses libparted to detect and manipulate devices and partitiontables while several (optional) filesystemtools
provide support for filesystems not included in libparted.
These optional packages will be detected at runtime and don't require a rebuild of GParted.

GParted is written in C++ and uses gtkmm as Graphical Toolkit. The general approach 
is to keep the GUI as simple as possible. That's why i try to conform to the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines.
