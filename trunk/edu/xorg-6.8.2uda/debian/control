Description: Distributed Multi-head X server
 Xdmx is a proxy X server that uses one or more other X servers as its display
 devices.  It provides multi-head X functionality for displays that might be
 located on different machines.  Xdmx functions as a front-end X server that acts
 as a proxy to a set of back-end X servers.  All of the visible rendering is passed
 to the back-end X servers.  Clients connect to the Xdmx front-end, and everything
 appears as it would in a regular multi-head configuration.  If Xinerama is enabled
 (e.g., with +xinerama on the command line), the clients see a single large screen.

Description: X Window System (X.Org) infrastructure
 xorg-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further
 installation of the X Window System in any configuration.
 .
 Those wishing an X server only (with remote font services and clients) will
 also require the xserver-common package and an X server package (most
 likely xserver-xorg).
 .
 The counterpart to the above configuration is a machine with the X libraries
 (the xlibs package), xbase-clients, a window manager, some X font packages,
 and likely many more client packages.
 .
 Those who desire a standalone X workstation (and/or are fuzzy on the concepts
 of X servers and X clients) will require both of the above sets of packages.
 For convenience, the "x-window-system" metapackage will include everything
 that is required for a standalone X workstation.
 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X", "X
 Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R6.8".  The version of X used in Debian
 is derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and is thus
 often also referred to as "X.Org".  All of the preceding quoted terms are
 functionally interchangeable in an Ubuntu system.
 .
 Until recently, Ubuntu shipped an X implementation released by The XFree86
 Project, Inc. (aka "XFree86").  The X.Org implementation is derived from the
 XFree86 implementation previously shipped, and is generally considered to be
 the standard implementation by vendors and distributors.
 .

 /usr/share/doc/xorg-common/ for assistance.

 (some of which, but not all, implement extensions to the X protocol) that do
 not exist in shared object form for various reasons (such as the fact that
 their APIs have not stabilized, or that they are deprecated).  Header files
 and manual pages are also provided.

    files.

 Xnest is an X server that is itself an X client.  This allows you to run a

 managers and other X clients.
 .
 Xnest relies upon its parent X server for font services.

Suggests: xserver-xorg | xserver, xfonts-base, xfonts-100dpi | xfonts-75dpi, xfonts-scalable, configlet-frontends
Description: files and utilities common to all X servers
 The X server is the hardware interface of the X Window System.  Its job is to
 communicate with video display and input devices, and present them in a
 standardized, abstract fashion via the X protocol to X clients (X-based
 programs).  The X server largely relieves programs of having to know or care
 about the details of the hardware with which they are interacting (such
 things as 32-bit versus 8-bit color, the layout of the keyboard, how many
 buttons the mouse has, etc.).  The catch is that the X server must itself
 know the technical specifications of the graphics hardware and monitor, the
 keyboard layout, the protocol used by the mouse, and so forth.
 .
 X servers either need fonts installed on the local host, or need to know of a
 remote host that provides font services (with xfs, for instance).  The former
 means that font packages are mandatory.  The latter means that font packages
 may be gratuitous.  To err on the side of caution, install at least the
 xfonts-base, xfonts-100dpi or xfonts-75dpi, and xfonts-scalable packages.

 The X.Org X server is an X server for several architectures and operating

 The X.Org server supports most modern graphics hardware from most vendors,
 and supersedes all XFree86 X servers.
 .
 If the discover, laptop-detect and xresprobe packages are installed,
 this package's configuration script will use them to attempt automatic
 configuration of the X server based on your information returned by your
 video card, mouse, and monitor.

Description: the X.Org X server (static version with debugging symbols)
 This package is a variant of the xserver-xorg package which includes a
 monolithic X.Org X server binary (as opposed to using loadable server
 modules on the architectures where they are supported) and which retains
 debugging symbols for execution tracing and core dump analysis.

 of the X.Org X server, but is not mandatory.  See the package description
 of xserver-xorg for further information.

Package: xvfb
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Pre-Depends: x-common (>= 1.05)
Suggests: xbase-clients
Description: virtual framebuffer X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices.  It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory.  The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment.  This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program from xbase-clients, hence the suggestion of xbase-clients.

Description: X Window System core components
 This metapackage provides the essential components for a standalone
 workstation running the X Window System.  It provides the X libraries, an X
 server (except on the S/390 architecture), a set of fonts, and a group of
 basic X clients and utilities.
 .
 Higher level metapackages, such as those for desktop environments, can
 depend on this package and simplify their dependencies.

 It should be noted that a package providing x-window-manager and a package
 providing x-terminal-emulator should also be installed to ensure a
 comfortable X experience.

 This metapackage provides the components of the X Window System as developed
 by the X.Org Project which are most interesting to programmers.
 .
 X Window System design documentation, manual pages, library reference works,
 unstripped and static versions of the shared libraries, C header files, and
 special versions of libraries available only in static form (with and without
 PIC symbols included) are supplied by the packages depended on by this
 metapackage.

 This package smooths upgrades from Ubuntu 5.04 ('Hoary') to Ubuntu 5.10
 ('Breezy') by ensuring that most miscellaneous utilities traditionally
 shipped with the sample implementation of X are installed.  For base X
 clients, see the xbase-clients transitional package.
