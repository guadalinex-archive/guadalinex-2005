xorg (6.8.2-77) breezy; urgency=low

  * Silence update-rc.d in xorg-common postrm.
  * Add ch(de) fallback for sg-latin1--* (closes: Ubuntu#8824).
  * Revert Wacom changes from -76.
  * Reinstate stripping of drivers.  'Whoops.'

xorg (6.8.2-76) breezy; urgency=low

  * Write stanza for Wacom tablets out by default.  As this uses /dev/wacom*
    stuff, it has no effect on the rest of the planet.
  * Blacklist all HP X300 RV370s a la -69.  Sigh. (closes: Ubuntu#16628).
  * Provide di-keymap us -> layout us mapping (closes: Ubuntu#17097).
  * Revert SiS regs.map changes; outsmarted by the SiS driver, which I assumed
    was just being dumb about it (closes: Ubuntu#16722).
  * Bring in drm.h from libdrm (proper modularisation would be too invasive),
    fixing DRI on amd64 (unsigned int vs unsigned long hilarity; closes:
    Ubuntu#16656).

xorg (6.8.2-74) breezy; urgency=low

  * Update tdfx and mga DDX versions to match the DRI drivers.

xorg (6.8.2-73) breezy; urgency=low

  * xserver-xorg dependency on xserver-xorg-input-* needs to be optionally
    removed for some architectures.  (Specifically, hppa has never delivered
    them, and that made xserver-xorg uninstallable.)

 -- LaMont Jones <lamont@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 30 Sep 2005 14:23:07 -0600

xorg (6.8.2-72) breezy; urgency=low

  * Add stanza for Wacom tablets per default in dexconf.
  * Update tdfx (closes: Ubuntu#15695), mga (closes: Ubuntu#15528), and sis
    DDX-side DRI bits to match Mesa, with mixed 32/64-bit DRI clients.
  * Only do a find if $REAL_DRIVER_DIRS is non-null, so we don't try a find
    across the root (ouch).

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 29 Sep 2005 11:19:23 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-71) breezy; urgency=low

  * Force 16 bit depth on savage driver.

xorg (6.8.2-69) breezy; urgency=low

  * Change AccelSucks/AccelLite/FullAccel behaviour: do full acceleration by
    default on RV370 chips, since they seem to largely be okay.  Only disable
    acceleration on R[CV]4xx chips, which are broken, and then disable all
    acceleration instead of accel lite, since drawing lines is just as quick
    in software as hardware, and we don't have to read back from the fb every
    time we draw a line.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 20 Sep 2005 17:30:17 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-68) breezy; urgency=low

  * Always write sync ranges when using the s3 driver, as it doesn't appear to
    even have the code to do DDC (closes: Ubuntu#11328).

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 16 Sep 2005 17:09:12 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-67) breezy; urgency=low

  * Add special cases for French and English (UK) keyboards, so we should be
    catching all of them now (closes: Ubuntu#10511).
  * Add Slovenian keyboard mappings (closes: Ubuntu#11252).

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 16 Sep 2005 17:02:21 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-66) breezy; urgency=low

  * Disable font server in dexconf for mad startup time victory.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 16 Sep 2005 11:25:05 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-65) breezy; urgency=low

  * Make AccelSucks cancellable by explicitly specifying Option "FullAccel"
    in xorg.conf.  If the rv370 variant is not vulnerable to dying really
    badly (which it probably isn't, by the looks), it should revert to the
    normal behaviour and only r{c,s}4xx chips affected.  Stay tuned.
  * Revert DRI protocol back to 4.x, so fglrx is all shiny again.  Note that
    this change breaks mixed 32/64-bit DRI clients.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 15 Sep 2005 09:36:08 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-64) breezy; urgency=low

  * Disable screen-to-screen copies and solid fills on certain of r3xx-based
    Radeons, as MMIO acceleration is very problematic there, and we don't
    currently have CP acceleration for newer stuff (closes: Ubuntu#12950,
    Ubuntu#10234).
  * Finally fix keyboard_drv vs kbd_drv hilarity once and for all.

xorg (6.8.2-63) breezy; urgency=low

xorg (6.8.2-62) breezy; urgency=low

  * Change 'la' (which has been repurposed from Latin American to Laotian) to
    'latam' in xserver-xorg.config.in (closes: Ubuntu#15209).

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 12 Sep 2005 12:41:56 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-61) breezy; urgency=low

  * Slightly invert the sense of the tests for when to write out sync ranges,
    so we don't spontaneously gain sync ranges when upgrading.
  * Update the i810 driver again, which fixes lockups when calling AdjustFrame,
    and fixes gamma in 8bpp modes.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri,  9 Sep 2005 12:32:15 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-60) breezy; urgency=low

  * Set module list to be separated by commas and spaces, not just commas, in
    xserver-xorg.config.in.  Thanks to Colin Watson and SÃ©bastien Bacher.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  8 Sep 2005 21:48:41 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-59) breezy; urgency=low

  * Mangle our sorting of the resolution lists to make sure we don't get
    pruning of resolutions with identical horizontal parts (ie: 1920x1440
    and 1920x1200 become 1920x1440 only, now we get both listed correctly)

 -- Adam Conrad <adconrad@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  8 Sep 2005 15:07:37 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-58) breezy; urgency=low

  * Keep a hard-coded list of resolution choices in xserver-xorg.templates,
    meaning that, while resolution choices must now be synchronised in *three*
    places, we actually get it right for the general case.  Should fix this
    properly, post-preview (closes: Ubuntu#14454).

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Wed,  7 Sep 2005 18:55:16 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-57) breezy; urgency=low

  * Implement a slightly more robust system for finding modules so we don't
    freak out people with /usr/lib/xorg/modules: directory not found.
  * If we've seen the modules question, but it's empty, force the 'seen' flag
    to false so we take the default, which should fix things for people who've
    been upgrading through breezy.
  * Write out sync ranges if we refuse probing or end up with sync ranges that
    aren't at all DDC-tastic (closes: Ubuntu#14378).
  * Add chips and siliconmotion drivers to bad-laptop-chipsets (closes:
    Ubuntu#14714).
  * Fix xrgb reference in xbase-clients (closes: Ubuntu#13976).
  * Update xserver-xorg description so we no longer encourage people to remove
    it.

xorg (6.8.2-56) breezy; urgency=low

  * Fix module searching in xserver-xorg.config.in (closes: Ubuntu#14430).
    + Give the genscripts target proper dependencies, also.
    + Tighten up the regex used to find modules.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  1 Sep 2005 11:59:07 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-55) breezy; urgency=low

  * Update libDRI version checks in all DRI drivers, to get DRI working again
    everywhere.
  * Update SiS DRI from HEAD to catch drift in the SISDRIRec.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 30 Aug 2005 08:47:42 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-54) breezy; urgency=low

  * The 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Beats?' release.
    + ... in which a once-mighty monolith is cut down to only a couple of
      servers, and a couple of metapackages.
  * Stop building libGL, as this is provided by mesa >= 6.3.1.1-0ubuntu1.
  * Update x-w-s-c's Depends to depend on libgl1-mesa for GL, and
    libgl1-mesa-dri for DRI (replacing libgl1-xorg and libgl1-xorg-dri,
    respectively).
  * More happy fun pruning of unneeded patches.
  * Update i810 driver to version from HEAD, minus VideoObjectModule changes.
    + Added Recommends: libgl1-mesa-dri (>= 6.3.1.1-0ubuntu1) to -i810, as the
      DRI<->DDX interface changed, and new DRI modules won't work with the old
      DDX.
  * Fill out xbase-clients and xutils dependencies, so we shouldn't be missing
    anything that will actually ship in breezy.
  * Stop installing libXfont in xlibs-static-dev; Build-Conflict with
    libxfont-dev.
  * Fix the ZAxisMapping default ('true' and 'false' are valid options for
    booleans; '4 5' is not).
  * Teach xserver-xorg.config.in about .so modules, and modules in
    /usr/lib/xorg/modules.
  * Change x11proto-panoramix-dev Build-Dep to -xinerama-.
  * Only seed a default of pc105 in the -z $XKBMODEL case (see -50); pc104
    defaults are seeded everywhere we use a us keymap, and abnt2 defaults are
    seeded everywhere we use a br keymap.  This reverts part of -50.
  * Change discover usage to --disable-all --enable=pci to avoid segfaults.

xorg (6.8.2-53) breezy; urgency=low

  * Right, so testing in clean chroots is something I keep yelling at other
    people for not doing.  Go me.  We now have a build-dep on libgl1-mesa-dev.

 -- Adam Conrad <adconrad@ubuntu.com>  Sun, 21 Aug 2005 05:51:57 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-52) breezy; urgency=low

  * And we grew a shiny new build dependency on x11proto-gl-dev.

 -- Adam Conrad <adconrad@ubuntu.com>  Sun, 21 Aug 2005 04:14:52 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-51) breezy; urgency=low

  * Change metapackage dependencies for the xorg -> mesa transition.
    (not actually removing the libgl1-xorg packages until -52, however)

 -- Adam Conrad <adconrad@ubuntu.com>  Sun, 21 Aug 2005 02:02:00 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-50) breezy; urgency=low

xorg (6.8.2-49) breezy; urgency=low

  * Update description and dependencies for xlibs-static-dev to reflect the
    package split.
  * Remove support for architectures which do not build an X server at all.
  * Kill libosmesa4 off.  The one package left using it can migrate to the
    Mesa version.  Remove libGLw also.
  * Remove MANIFESTs for alpha, arm, hurd-i386, m68k, mips, mipsel, and
    s390, as they were hopelessly out of date anyway, and
    architecture-specific patches for those architectures.
  * Remove a whole swathe of unused code from shell-lib.sh.
  * Remove unused xorgconf manpage rewrite, an xev fix, and substantial
    changes to the fonts Imakefiles.
  * Fix loading of libglide3 modules for specific chipsets (Voodoo3 and
    Voodoo5).
  * Correct DefaultFontPath.
  * Remove all old Conflicts/Replaces (pre-Warty, most of the pre-Hoary stuff
    also).  This simplifies all the package relationships *massively*, which
    will hopefully make dpkg stop segfaulting when attempting to fulfill
    libqt3-mt-dev's Build-Depends.  Yay for clean solutions.
  * Remove ancient and out-of-date NEWS file.
  * Stop building man pages for stuff we don't ship.
  * Bump xserver-xorg/autodetect_monitor priority to medium.
  * Shuffle around the XKB layout detection code to use auto_answer instead of
    db_set && db_input; move abnt2 model special-casing to the layout tree
    instead.
  * Remove libxp6-dbg from x-w-s-d dependencies (closes: Ubuntu#13252).

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 11 Aug 2005 11:11:34 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-48) breezy; urgency=low

  * Fix auto_answer syntax for write_files_section and write_dri_section.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 10 Aug 2005 18:13:14 +0100

xorg (6.8.2-47) breezy; urgency=low

  * Add Pre-Depends on x-common back to xserver-xorg, so pointers to
    /usr/bin/X11/Xorg aren't broken.  Also add them to xdmx and xvfb.
  * Bump xserver-xorg-core's Replaces on xserver-xorg from -45 to -46
    (artefact of development interrupted by other uploads).
  * Make xlibs depend on xkeyboard-config.
  * Build -v4l on amd64.
  * Only run large swathes of the xserver-xorg.config.in when we're doing
    reconfig or firstinst, and add auto_answer to some bare db_inputs.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 10 Aug 2005 20:43:08 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-46) breezy; urgency=low

  * Restrict arch list for -driver-v4l to architecures which build a loadable
    server.
  * Remove libglu1-mesa-dbg from x-w-s Depends, as Mesa doesn't (yet) build
    debug packages.
  * Fix all outstanding references to xlibmesa-gl (closes: Ubuntu#13270).
  * Make sure we reset default_depth in xserver-xorg.postinst.in as well.
  * Move 'Xorg' symlink from xserver-xorg to -core.
  * Reintroduce xbase-clients and xutils as metapackages.  Note that they are
    still incomplete.
  * Change DefaultFontPath to /usr/share/X11/fonts, so servers with hardcoded
    font paths like Xnest can pick fonts up properly.
  * Add symlinks into /usr/bin/X11 for Xnest and Xdmx.
  * Fix libosmesa4-xorg-dev's dependency on libgl1-xorg-dev.
  * Reinstate all amd64 packaging files -- errr ...

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Mon,  8 Aug 2005 12:22:11 +1000

xorg (6.8.2-45) breezy; urgency=low

xorg (6.8.2-44) breezy; urgency=low

  * The 'Music Has the Right to Children' release.
  * Break out the last of the libraries -- libxkbfile, libxkbui, libdmx,
    libxxf86{dga,misc,vm}, libxtrap, libxmu, libxt, libxaw, libfs, libxpm,
    libfontenc and libxfontcache.  Only libxf86config and libxfont (these
    are harder to do with a monolithic server) and the GL stuff left.
  * Get rid of the last of the xlibmesa* braindamage:
    + xlibmesa-gl* -> libgl1-xorg, libgl1-xorg-dev, libgl1-xorg-dbg
    + xlibmesa-dri -> libgl1-xorg-dri
    + xlibosmesa* -> libosmesa4-xorg, libosmesa4-xorg-dev, libosmesa4-xorg-dbg
    + XLIBMESA_GL_SPECIAL_DEPENDS simply pruned as it was unused.
    + Drop libglu1-xorg* entirely; libGLU can be provided by Mesa.
  * Sanitise Build-Depends again.
  * Patch cleanup: remove all patches for stuff we don't ship.
  * Don't build any DMX-related sample programs in xc/programs/Xserver/hw/dmx.
  * Remove build-server hooks which are no longer relevant to us.
  * Update Canonical copyright in debian/copyright to cover 2005.
  * Protect against $2 being empty in xlibs.preinst.in, which would cause it
    to bomb when we were installing from scratch.  Don't make failures to
    remove directories hard failures.
  * Integrate patch to add rotation support to the Wacom input driver (thanks,
    Matthew Garrett).
  * Patch #064: Disable building xorgcfg and xorgconfig, by making
    BuildXFree86ConfigTools meaningful, and defining it to no.
  * Renumber 060_fix_XOrgManDefs.diff to #061, as it clashed with the external
    Xrender/Xft/Xcursor patches, and I need to edit those for offsets all the
    time (very annoying).
  * Fix mappings for Dvorak, fr-latin9, tr_f/tr_q, se_FI, se_NO, and most
    other keyboard mappings in xserver-xorg.config.in.  Add support for
    seeding the model as well as the variant, and seed the model to pc104 for
    us-layout keyboards.  This should catch most of the changes made with
    xkeyboard-config.  Seed variants for variants (e.g. us(dvorak) -> layout
    us, variant dvorak), rather than options.
  * Add v4l driver back (missing since the initial release).
  * Add missing alpine and laguna modules back to -driver-cirrus.
  * Change debconf dependencies to use ${misc:Depends} instead.
  * Re-debconf-updatepo the package.
  * Remove support for mdetect completely, as we didn't use it really, and it
    was flaky and horrible (mainly the Debconf code).  Hardcode in a default
    of /dev/input/mice and ImPS/2.

  * 'Can I keep the baby pictures?' 'No.' 'But-' 'National security.'
  * Move xlibs.postinst.in contents to xlibs.preinst.in, averting a
    Pre-Depends: xlibs (>= 6.8.2-43) from xkeyboard-config.
  * Replace test -d's with more robust if constructs in xlibs.preinst.in,
    and only try to nuke XKB when we're upgrading from an old version.
  * Add Depends: xkeyboard-config to x-window-system.
  * Revert the C++ ABI transition for libGLU, as it only provides a C ABI;
    this parallels a change in Mesa.

  * Stop building all programs except for the server; split out xbase-clients
    and xutils.
  * Change render-dev Build-Depends to x11proto-render-dev, the new package.
  * Add proper paths to xvfb-run (thanks, SÃ©bastien Bacher).
  * Prune still more packaging files for libraries that I forgot to remove.
  * Remove XKB data from the xlibs package; keep the package itself around
    purely to remove old configuration files, as dpkg seems unable to handle
    this on its own.
  * Remove xlibs-pic, xlibs-dbg, and xlibmesa-dev, which were only needed for
    upgrades from woody.
  * Remove a whole boatload of patches for stuff we no longer build.  Yippee!
  * Move xdmx to Architecture: any (paralleling a similar change in Debian's
    xorg-x11). 
  * Add kbd_drv back to xserver-xorg-input-keyboard, and change Driver

  * Break xvinfo out to a separate module.
  * Remove xlibmesa-dev package, which is only needed for upgrades from woody.
  * Remove xspecs and xlibs-static-pic dependency from x-window-system-dev.
  * Change hard = ${Source-Version} dependencies from drivers to the server
    core to a more loose dependency which needs to be manually bumped every
    time the server ABI changes incompatibly.  Which also happens to solve the
    problem of the Depends going wandering entirely.  Whoops.

    + Display drivers: xserver-xorg-driver-apm, xserver-xorg-driver-ark,
      xserver-xorg-driver-ati, xserver-xorg-driver-chips,
      xserver-xorg-driver-cirrus, xserver-xorg-driver-cyrix,

    + Configuration is still in the xserver-xorg package, but this will
      change in the future (when we all have flying cars).
  * Make autodetect_keyboard use auto_answer with a default of true for the
    first install and false otherwise, fixing broken initial installs.
  * Add xserver-xorg-dbg to the list of servers dexconf knows about.
  * Another i810 update from HEAD, which should hopefully fix Xvideo pitch
    problems harder (closes: Ubuntu#12170).
  * Remove the last remnants of rstart from the xutils packaging.
  * Remove xlibs-static-pic.NEWS, which was a) outdated, and b) misleading.
  * Make manifest-install-reconcile deal with this brave post-MANIFEST.all
    world.
  * Stop shipping README.rapidaccess, which was complete crack, and docs for
    SCO/Solaris/*BSD/Darwin/LynxOS.  Since all architectures now ship the same
    set of core xorg documentation, just have a single xserver-xorg.docs.
  * debian/rules prune: remove special-case handling for packages which aren't
    even shipped anymore.
  * Other-architecture cleanup: remove
    xlibs-static-pic.install.{s390,hurd-i386,netbsd-i386},
    xlibs-static-dev.install.hurd-i386, and xlibs-data.install.s390, since
    they were identical to the normal versions.
  * Remove debian/local/README.Debian-upgrade, since it is now so out of date
    as to be useless.
  * Cull the xmh package.
  * Remove patches #017, #086, #099a and #099c, since we no longer build libX11.
  * Remove patch #016, as we no longer build libICE.
  * Rename libglu-dev-xorg to libglu1-xorg-dev, and libglu1-dbg-xorg to
    libglu1-xorg-dbg, to sync up with Debian.
  * Remove XF86Config manpage.  XFree86 3.x is dead.  Let it go.
  * Remove lbxproxy, proxymngr and xfwp package files.
  * Remove now-redundant -DXprtServer=NO in -dbg building.
  * Move all xfree86 package changelogs to changelog.Debian.old.
  * Remove libglu1-xorg-dev's dependency on libstdc++-dev alternatives.
  * Rationalise build-deps: remove a bunch of stuff which we B-D upon, but no
    longer use.  Significantly, tetex-bin is gone; groff, libpng,
    bsdmainutils, fontconfig, libxcursor-dev, and lynx are also gone.
  * Remove 008_fix_xgetpw_macro.diff, bump B-D on x11proto-core-dev to
    6.8.99.2.  This patch was also broken in various ways, per upstream
    discussion, and we'll get a real fix via upstream, when it gets sorted
    out.
  * Drop Pre-Depends on x-common from various packages, since it was only
    complicating upgrades.
  * Don't bother with debian/imports; clean up remnants of xlibmesa-drm-source
    packaging.
  * Remove meaningless $Id$ tags -- this hasn't been from SVN for about a
    year now.
  * Remove dexlet, which was incapable of configuring xserver-xorg anyway.
    Obviously not too widely used ...
  * Stop building rstart for real, for real.

  * Revert X{Error,Keysym}DB parts of -32; these belong in libx11-6.
  * Move xkb symlinks from -32 to xlibs, since that's where the XKB data is.
  * Change force_keyboard_redetection flag to autodetect_keyboard, to be more
    consistent.
  * Debconf cleanup: remove unused and atrophied monitor code from
    xserver-xorg.config.in, remove misleading Subversion Id lines, clean up a
    bad use of $XORG_FORCE_PROBE, and more.  Always prompt for whether or not
    to redetect video card/keyboard/monitor on reconfiguring (well, at
    priority high, anyway).
  * Make autodetect_{video_card,monitor} actually meaningful (closes:
    Ubuntu#12072).
  * Add Pre-Depends on x-common (>= 1.0) to xserver-common and xlibs.
  * Move Xorg symlink from /usr/bin/X11 to /usr/bin, as the former is becoming
    a symlink to the latter with the new x-common.  Ditto X symlink.
  * Update i810 driver to latest from HEAD (modulo DRI interface change and
    InstallVideoObjectModule) to add i945 support, further fix mode validation,
    fix up Xv support (closes: Ubuntu#12172, #11674), et al.
  * Update SiS driver from HEAD (modulo DRI interface change, etc, etc) to fix
    DRI on 610 (closes: Ubuntu#6243), add non-rectangular MergedFB layouts,
    and other such hilarity.
  * Add xfree86.lst -> xorg.lst symlink (closes: Ubuntu#12167).
  * Add patch from Owen Taylor to fix repeating Pictures in offscreen memory
    in the fb layer (closes: Ubuntu#11941).
  * Add Conflicts/Replaces on old libx11-6 from xlibs-data (closes:
    Ubuntu#12108).
  * Exclude xorg-common from possible 'smoking guns' in looking for file
    overlaps.

  * Force removal of xfree86-common init.d script if it hasn't been changed
    (closes: Ubuntu#8833).
  * Update i810 driver from HEAD to fix DDC mode validation (closes:
    Ubuntu#7878).
  * Add patch to MGA driver to prevent corruption on Mystique (closes:
    Ubuntu#10065).
  * Add patch from HEAD to fix Savage CLUT being left in 6-bit mode even in
    24-bit modes; remove blacklisting that forced Savages to 16-bit per
    default (really closes: Ubuntu#6127).
  * Only include linux/config.h in drm.h if __KERNEL__, fixing FTBFS with
    linux-libc-headers; thanks, Dave Airlie.
  * Only class tr_f and not tr (aka Turkish Q) as a non-Latin layout; change
    trfu and trqu mappings to trf and trq (closes: Ubuntu#9209).
  * gcc4 transition: change xlibmesa-glu to libglu1-xorg, ditto -dbg, and
    xlibmesa-glu-dev to libglu-dev-xorg.
  * Fix radeon_probe.h build with gcc4 (patch #024d).
  * Bump libxrender-dev Build-Dep to /usr-transitioned version; add explicit
    render-dev Build-Dep, at /usr-transitioned version; ditto libxft-dev and
    libxcursor-dev.
  * Add debian/patches/991_ubuntu_gcc_flags.diff, which fixes fbmmx's build
    with gcc4 (thanks Fabio).

    after a DDC probe had finished, which would render Apple Studio Displays
    useless.
  * Don't reset all templates when migrating from xserver-xfree86; this will

  * Ensure $RECONFIGURE is set in postinst when we call xresprobeint, so the
    modes question doesn't get bumped to PRIORITY=medium when it shouldn't.
  * Add locale mapping for en_DK.UTF-8 (closes: Ubuntu#7690).
  * Add support from getting the bit depth from xresprobe if it tells us; the
    current intended use case is for Intel cards which do not support 24bpp,
    so we can fall back to 16.  Support for this was added in xresprobe
    0.4.15.
  * Make xorg-common depend on lsb-base, as it uses lsb-functions in its init
    script (closes: Ubuntu#7256).
  * Update nv driver from X.Org HEAD:
    + Fixes initialisation problems for chipsets where ChipID & 0xfff0 ==

  * New upstream version (update from 6.8.1.904).
    + Contains AMD64 PCIE BAR fix (closes: Ubuntu#6085).
    + Remove patches which were applied upstream, reshuffle others.
    + Rename 000_stolen_from_6.8_branch_benh_ati.diff to #022 to better
      reflect its status; it did not make 6.8.2 and will probably not make
      6.8.3, either.  Update with a fix from benh to ensure that the PLL
      dividers were always taken from the BIOS if we need to use them (closes:
      Ubuntu#6223).
    + Revert RADEONSetFBLocation() breakage that crept into 6.8.2 shortly
      before release.
    + Update Via driver from unichrome.sf.net (closes: Ubuntu#6887).
    + Update i810 driver from HEAD, which fixes video artifacts among other
      things (closes: Ubuntu#5738).  CRT mode validation still broken.
  * Allow XORG_CONFIG="custom" to be passed to Debconfiscation.  Leaves
    xorg.conf alone.  Source variables from /etc/default/xorg, which doesn't
    exist by default.
  * Add some more r128 chip identifiers to our special sync range
    blacklisting.
  * Fix extraneous quoting in xvfb-run, again (closes: Ubuntu#5531).
  * Fix second TMDS head initialisation on r3xx (closes: Ubuntu#4343).
  * Ensure sync ranges are written out if we ask the user for them (closes:
    Ubuntu#6184).
  * Add 1920x1200 modes, sans sync ranges for now (closes: Ubuntu#6252).
  * Remove #031 (glxinfo_makefile) as it was incorrect, per upstream, and
    just ensure that libGLU is linked against libstdc++ instead.
  * Patches #054 and #055 (evdev keyboard/mouse): change "Device" to "Dev
    Device" in the options section.  The configuration parser thoughtfully
    puts a default of /dev/psaux for the mouse's Device, thus making it
    impossible to specify Dev Name/Dev Phys and not Device.
  * Fix numerous interactions with dpkg-reconfigure and
    xserver-xorg.config.in, so it should now just preserve configuration
    changes on upgrades, and probe and write upgrades when invoked via
    dpkg-reconfigure and the first time (closes: Ubuntu#6484).
  * Silently migrate server symlink from /usr/X11R6/bin/Xorg to
    /usr/bin/X11/Xorg, which should silence a few errors.
  * Strip .UTF-8 and @euro from the end of $LANG in xserver-xorg.config.in,
    to fix the $LANG->keyboard layout problem (closes: Ubuntu#6270).
  * Change 'xfree86' to 'xorg' in keyboard ruleset template (closes:
    Ubuntu#6477).
  * Change the default bitdepth on Savage to 24 (closes: Ubuntu#6127).
  * Ensure that we prompt at priority critical if we can't properly guess the
    keyboard layout, although we shouldn't have to guess.

    6.8.1-1ubuntu14; the changelog entries for 14 and 15 are here for
    historical purposes only.
  * Also write sync ranges out if DDC fails completely -> no resolutions, no
    sync ranges from DDC; tidy up code so sync ranges get written unless
    either we're on a laptop with a non-blacklisted chipset, or we're on a
    CRT/desktop LCD, and DDC succeeds and provides us with a sync range, or
    the user has been asked about them (closes: Ubuntu#6184).
  * Since DDC with powerpc/ati seems to be so flaky, blacklist every ATI card
    on PowerPC in terms of writing out sync ranges (closes; Ubuntu#6117).
  * Clear out $XORGTEMPLATES on xserver-xorg.config.in if XORG_FORCE_PROBE is
    either null or "yes", as opposed to if it was non-zero.  Reverse test in
    xserver-xorg.config.in so that auto_answer will only attempt to use an
    existing answer if it's actually there.
  * Add additional backwards compatibility in terms of accepting "yes" for
    XORG_FORCE_PROBE everywhere a null is accepted.
  * If we come up with UNKNOWN as a keyboard layout, bump the question
    priority right up to critical, regardless of whether or not we're
    reconfiguring.
  * Remove extraneous quotes in xvfb-run (closes: Ubuntu#5531).

  * Pull fix to I2C code to properly deal with waiting, which should fix DDC
    probes on a few monitors (closes: Ubuntu#6032).
  * Rewrite Debconf logic to write a new xorg.conf if it doesn't exist, and
    default to using xresprobe (use XORG_FORCE_PROBE=no to disable this
    behaviour).  If invoked via dpkg-reconfigure, write a new configuration
    file and back the old one up.  Always let the user know if we're not
    touching it (promote many messages from observe to warn).
  * Add i915_dri.so to amd64 install files.
  * Resume building tdfx_dri.so on amd64 and ia64 (stolen from HEAD);
    remove sis_dri.so from ia64 install files as it is 64-bit unclean.
  * Stop shipping tdfx_dri.so on powerpc.
  * Fix cat-walking-across-keyboard attack in dexconf; add dexconf to list of
    files which get shell-sanity-checked at build time.
  * Remove Speedo directory from list of server-side fonts, and stop shipping
    all Speedo fonts.  No-op the speedo module within #028.
  * Mirror changes to xfree86.cf in #003 to xorg.cf as well, since the former
    is deprecated; clean up LinuxDebian section in linux.cf, grooming it for
    total removal.  Get rid of DefaultGcc2{i386,AMD64,Ppc,Ppc64,Axp}Opt, since
    it was defined to the default set of arguments anyway.
  * Remove patch #913 (don't load Verite/MGA firmware), and add firmware to
    000_stolen_from_6.8_branch.diff.
  * Move *.1 manpages to *.1x, a change that got lost from xfree86->xorg.
  * Move cirrus_laguna.o, cirrus_alpine.o and riva128.o to *_drv.o.

    (aka 6.8.2RC3).
  * Disable building of largely defunct XRX plugin in linux.cf.
  * Guess at a reasonable default for $DISPLAY_TYPE if xresprobe doesn't feed
    us a display type (closes: Ubuntu#5639).
  * Set $LAPTOP in xserver-xorg.postinst.in.
  * Move the test for resolutions-via-DDC-but-no-sync-ranges around in
    xserver-xorg.postinst.in, so $NRES is set when we call it (closes:

  * Write sync ranges for all r128s on powerpc (closes: Ubuntu#5940).
  * Remove speedo and v4l from the list of modules loaded per default.
  * Fix comments at the top of the config file to be more accurate (closes:
    Ubuntu#5748).
  * Don't load GLcore in the default set of modules, per Adam Jackson.
  * Add hardened Linux support via a small call in postinst.
  * Change default builder from canonical.com -> ubuntu.com.
  * Add <X11/Xlib.h> to scrnsaver.h's #includes, add libx11-dev dep to

    disabling the framebuffer when reconfiguring.
  * Move logic for when to write sync ranges from dexconf to
    xserver-xorg.postinst(.in), so we can work out when DDC did or didn't
    succeed.  Based on this, if we have a list of resolutions, are on a CRT,
    but don't have a list of sync ranges, write sync ranges out (closes:
    Ubuntu#4614).
  * Bump recommendation on xresprobe to >= 0.4.13, since the disptype stanza
    was only introduced in that release.
  * Add XORG_SYNC_RANGES environment variable; set it to yes to always get
    HorizSync/VertRefresh lines written out.
  * Special-case the tdfx driver to default to 16bpp, so we can have DRI
    enabled per default.
  * Stop blacklisting via driver for xresprobe now we have unichrome from HEAD.
  * Add id_ID -> us $LANG/xkb mapping.
  * Backport Mesa 6.2.x branch, which should stop r128+DRI hangs on start on
    powerpc, and introduces i8xx DRI suspend/resume support (closes:
    Ubuntu#4705).
  * Pull the entirety of the i8xx driver back from head; partially because of

  * Pull i8xx/i915 driver back from HEAD, as it contains numerous improvements
    from Tungsten -- i915GM support, PanelID support, and support for custom
    video modes in the video BIOS, eliminating the need for
    855wrap/855resolution/865patch, et al (closes: Ubuntu#2827).

  * Map right Apple -> Level 3 shift (AltGr) on Macintosh European layouts per

  * dexconf: use dpkg --print-installation-architecture instead of
    dpkg-architecture, so we can do clean installs on hoary (and

    written out, and via to the list of LVDS-driving chipsets which need sync
    ranges also (closes: Ubuntu#5085).
  * Add #099p, which changes the second level of tilde from backslash to Ã© on
    Turkish keyboards (closes: Ubuntu#5318).
  * Backport the entire via driver from the Unichrome project.
  * Rename XORGFORCEPROBE to XORG_FORCE_PROBE; make .config.in reset all
    values to defaults if this environment variable is set (semantics note:
    change most $RECONFIGURE tests to assume first install if -z $RECONFIGURE
    || -n $XORG_FORCE_PROBE, so you get the equivalent of the first install).

    installs libglx.so.  Also eliminate use of regular expressions in
    LoaderListDirs and LoaderGetCanonicalName, which should shave a bit of CPU
    time off.
  * Use xc/config/util/lndir instead of cp -al to create a shadow tree for
    building the debug server, which should make it more portable across
    multiple filesystems, as well as being a lot quicker to copy originally.
  * Update MANIFEST.hppa.in and all install files to currency (thanks, LaMont
    Jones).
  * Add xorgversion.def and Xprt.1 to MANIFEST.ia64.in, fixing FTBFS.
  * Force a tight, same-version, dependency on xlibmesa-gl from xlibosmesa4

  * Add XKB support for extended functions of CyMotion Master Linux and A4Tech
    KB21 keyboards (closes: Ubuntu#4245, Ubuntu#5171).
  * Add patch from Alex Deucher to hopefully resolve the problem on Radeons
    whereby initialising CRTC2 didn't set DPMS up properly, so the second head

    then on via DPMS (closes: Ubuntu#4343).
  * Merge changes from Debian XFree86 packaging since we moved to X.Org

xorg (6.8.1-1ubuntu4) hoary; urgency=low

  * Remove debian/patches/099d*, as it broke UTF-8 locale handling and didn't
    actually fix the xterm manpage at all (closes: Ubuntu#3645).

  * Add patches stolen from the X.Org 6.8.x branch, including:
    + Perform soft resets right on non-r3xx (fd.o#988).
    + Prevent segfault in GLX on certain GL versions (fd.o#1672).
    + Fix server crash when unsetting screensaver attributes (fd.o#1695).
      (fd.o#591).
    + Prevent conflict with certain #defined constants (bool) in xf86cfg
      (fd.o#557).
    + Drag nVidia driver back from XFree86 (via X.Org HEAD) with more hardware
      support, fix for DPMS issues, PCI-Xpress support, DPMS on DVI, cursor
      fixes for NV11, proper console restoration, and Xv syncing on vblank
      (fd.o#1777).
    + Fix a stack overflow in XKB handling within libX11 (fd.o#1459).
    + Fix xmodmap stack overflow (fd.o#1818).
    + Fix from myself to fix panel size derivation when stretching is enabled
      (fd.o#1881, Ubuntu#1218).
    + Include server control keys in macintosh/us XKB definition (fd.o#1872).
    + Actually reset DPMS timer on input (fd.o#792, Ubuntu#3614).
    + Move all the fixes from #000 Fedora to this patch, as they have since
      been approved for 6.8.2.
    - New: debian/patches/000_stolen_from_6.8_branch.diff
    - Removed: debian/patches/000_stolen_from_fedora.diff
    + Large patch from Ben Herrenschmidt rejigging the detection logic for
      many ATI cards; see annotation in patch.  Note that this is not yet
      committed, so this patch is subject to change and hasn't yet been folded
      into _6.8_branch.diff.  This patch obsoletes #099m.
      - New: debian/patches/000_stolen_from_6.8_branch_benh_ati.diff
      - Updated:
      debian/patches/024_ati_r128_and_radeon_enable_build_without_vgahw.diff
      - Removed: debian/patches/099m_radeon_fwpll_support.diff

    (closes: Ubuntu#2411).
    + New: debian/patches/025_r128_remove_interrupt_handler.diff

  * Add 1440x900 @ 100Hz modeline for 17" Apple iMacs (closes: Ubuntu#3712).
    + Updated: debian/xserver-xorg.templates,
      debian/989_ubuntu_add_extra_modelines_from_xorg.diff

  * Stop writing out HorizSync and VertRefresh lines to xorg.conf; if it can
    be detected by DDC, then let the driver do that instead of tying us to a
    specific monitor, and if we need to calculate it from the resolution, then
    it's a driver bug that needs fixing.
    + Updated: debian/local/dexconf.

  * First cut at proper ia64 control files (closes: Ubuntu#3817).
    + Updated: debian/MANIFEST.ia64.in, debian/xserver-xorg.install.ia64,
      debian/xlibmesa-dri.install.ia64, debian/xlibmesa-dri-dbg.install.ia64,
      debian/xserver-xorg.docs.ia64

  * Stop shipping damage.h, which is an old preliminary cut at the Damage
    client API; superseded by Xdamage.h.
    + Updated: MANIFEST.*.in, libxdamage-dev.install.

  * Fix link name (Xres->XRes) in libxres1.

  * Make libx11-dev Depend on libxkbfile-dev, and libxp-dev on libxau-dev, as
    they use files from these libraries.

  * Add dmxext.h and dmxproto.h to libdmx-dev.

  * Ship Xorg-debug.1 in xserver-xorg-dbg instead of Xorg-debug.1x (thanks,
    James Troup).

    etc/X11/xkb/rules/xorg{,.xml}.
    This will avoid breakage on custom configurartions due to upstream rename
    of the files.

  * Add FAQ entry: What are Debian's plans with respect to X.Org and

    selection-method user value on reconfiguration.
    This fix will catch all the unknown resolutions without projecting the
    users back in time to a 640x480@60Hz view of the world, both at

    since xlibs is an architecture "all" package.  Now the script will
    actually be shipped.

  * If the restorecon command is available, restore SELinux file security
    contexts after setting up X server and ICE socket directories
    (xfree86-common) and font server socket directories (xfs) after creating
    them in the init scripts.  (Closes: #268812, #271030)

  * Fix missing-word typo in xnest's package description.  Thanks to Roland
    Stigge for catching this.  (Closes: #268997)

  * Add FAQ entry: What is the story with XFree86 3.x?

  * Apply some fixes to the XFree86 X server's ELF object loader:
    + Stop conditionally #including <sys/mman.h> since it is unconditionally
      imported earlier in the file.
    + Perform an mprotect() for AMD64 Linux systems as well as OpenBSD to
      prevent SEGVs on NX-enabled kernels.  (Closes: #277699)
    + Fix a problem with parentheses when using the preprocessor (doesn't
      affect Debian, but would cause unexpected behavior on OpenBSD).

  * Perform some cleanup work on the shared library maintainer scripts of
    libdps1, libxaw6, libxaw7, xlibmesa-gl, xlibmesa-glu, and xlibosmesa4;
    thanks to Fabio for noticing the inconsistencies.
    + Call register_x_lib_dir_with_ld_so() before invoking ldconfig in the
      post-installation scripts.
    + Perform configuration actions regardless of the value of "$1" in the
      post-installation scripts.
    + Call deregister_x_lib_dir_with_ld_so() before invoking ldconfig in the
      post-removal scripts.
    + Move the #DEBHELPER# expando later in the scripts where applicable.

  * Perform some cleanup work on the update-fonts-{alias,dir,scale} utilities
    and their manual pages.
    + Re-indent at four spaces.
    + Query terminal for its width if $COLUMNS is not set, as shell-lib.sh
      does.  Fall back to a width of 80 if stty returns garbage or nothing.
    + Rename error() to die().
    + Add usage() function and -h, --help option.
    + Use exit status 2 to indicate usage errors as opposed to operational
      failures.
    + Be more careful with quoting shell variables.
    + Add and expand comments.
    + Add SVN Id keyword.
    + Update Vim modeline.
    + Update manual pages to document changes in interface and behavior (there
      are no backwards-incomaptible changes).

  * Perform some cleanup work on the xvfb-run utility and its manual page.
    + Query terminal for its width if $COLUMNS is not set, as shell-lib.sh
      does.  Fall back to a width of 80 if stty returns garbage or nothing.
    + Add message() and error() functions.
    + Enhance usage() function to (additionally) display an error message
      consisting of the function arguments, if any.
    + Use error() and usage() instead of echo for error messages.
    + Cosmetically tidy up usage message, and correct a typo.
    + Declare locally-scoped variable in find_free_servernum().
    + Store getopt's exit status and report it in an error message if it is
      nonzero.
    + Clarify the error message if getopt rearranges the command line in a way
      we don't expect.
    + Tidy up comment, shell function, and redirection style.  Wrap long
      lines.  Quote variables that may have whitespace in them.  Update Vim
      modeline.
    + Describe effect of $COLUMNS environment variable in manpage.
    + Remove erroneous description of exit status 1, and explain why it is not
      used.
    + Add description of exit statuses 0, 4, 5, and 6.
    + Fix markup error.

  * Replace many occurences of XSI connectives in test(1) with POSIX shell
    connectives in scripts.

  * Apply patch from David Mosberger that replaces the fix for #225526 with
    one that works on systems that do not have a PCI bus numbered 0.  Thanks,
    David!  (Closes: #279436)

  * Apply patch from Richard Mortimer to fix the XFree86 X server's ELF object
    loader to set the PROT_EXEC flag on mmap()ed modules regardless of machine
    architecture.  (It was already trying to do this, but there are two
    preprocessor statements involved, and we were only patching one.)
    (Closes: #280384)

  * Add magic register poke to neomagic driver which apparently speeds up DVD
    playback operations.  Thanks to Tony Hill for finding this patch.
    Unfortunately, despite efforts to locate some, there appears to be no
    documentation of why this register poke works.  (Closes: #277038)

  * Make factual updates, clarifications, and wording corrections to the FAQ:
    + Point out that the X.Org relicensing debacle was back in 1998, not
      recent.
    + Be more clear about why OS distributors stuck with XFree86 after it was
      forked, but before it was relicensed.
    + Identify which license is referred to as the "XFree86 1.1 license".
    + Clarify the origin of the contradictory statements regarding the
      GPL-compatibility of XFree86.
    + Clarify the discussion of the "relicensing pilot project" that was
      performed on the XFree86 "auto-config" code.  The code was checked in,
      *then* relicensed without other changes.
    + Point out that most distributors have settled on X.Org's X11R6.8.1 for
      their X Window System implementation, at least for the time being.
    + Stress that XFree86 3.x is no longer supported.
    + Remove language that discusses future directions of XFree86 3.x support
      in dexconf, since it is unlikely that that work is going to happen.

  * Increase the minimum pixel clock for Matrox cards based on feedback from
    Teemu Ikonen.  (Closes: #261993)

  * Tidy up and improve fbdev driver messages, correcting spelling, adding
    information, and otherwise enhancing them.  (Closes: #275318)

  Changes by Denis Barbier and Fabio M. Di Nitto:

  * Add several multi-layout aware layouts:
    + ca (Canada) contains several variants: "fr" is meant as a replacement
      for ca_enhanced, "fr-legacy" is another variant, and "multi" is an
      implementation of CAN/CSA-Z243.200-92.  This standard requires two
      groups, so it is in fact divided into "multi" and "multi-2gr" variants.
      By default, "ca" loads both "multi" and "multi-2gr" to provide a
      full-featured keyboard.  When it is combined with other layouts, the
      simpler variant "fr" is used, but others can be explicitly specified.
      (Closes: #245371, #252068, #258575)
    + The new ca layout also fixes ISO_Level3_Shift, which was mapped to
      <RCTL> instead of <RALT>.  (Closes: #274457)
    + jp (Japan) also requires a combination of two variants.  When this is
      the only loaded layout, the full combination is used.  When this layout
      is combined with others, only the "jp106" variant is loaded.
    + hu (Hungary) layout has been simplified; some variants have been removed.
      (Closes: #263561)
    + ch (Switzerland) replaces de_CH and fr_CH.
    + mn (Mongolia) and vn (Vietnam) are simple layouts.

  * In UTF-8 compose files, replace U00xx Unicode codepoints by the
    corresponding keysyms.  Otherwise the compose character is in
    the range 0x01000000-0x010000FF which is not valid according to
    appendix A of the X11 protocol.  Even if most applications are able
    to recognize these broken characters, few of them fail, most notably
    xemacs and users are then unable to use composition when in UTF-8
    locales.  (Closes: #235574)

  * Note: the above keyboard changes are supposed to partially fix Ubuntu bugs:
    1089, 1390, 1506.

  Changes by Fabio M. Di Nitto:

  * Update wacom input driver from http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/ up to
    version 0.6.4:
    + Remove now obsolete patch 036_wacom_usb_tablet_update.diff
    + Add patch 000_stolen_from_sourceforge_wacom_driver.diff
    + Fix input timeout problems if the device is not connected.
      No references are available in upstream changelog, but tests do not
      show this behavior anymore. (Closes: #231837)
    + Fix compatibility with kernel 2.6 wacom driver. (Closes: #250331)
    + Add support for Cintiq boards. According to #172526 logs the patch
      has been included, reworked and cleaned by upstream a long time ago.
      No references are available in upstream changelog. (Closes: #172526)
    + A combination of new kernel, xfree86 and wacom driver appears to have
      fixed the APM resume issue as described in #80140. Tests done
      on a powerpc laptop do not show this problem anymore.
      No references are available in upstream changelog. (Closes: #80140)
    (Closes: #1117)

  * Add workaround for the UseBIOS default setting in the savage driver:
    + Add patch 099i_pro_savage_ddr_set_use_bios_to_false.diff
    + Set UseBios default to "no" for PROSAVAGE_DDR and PROSAVAGE_DDRK, as
      described here http://www.probo.com/timr/savage40.html.
    (Closes: #2111)

  * Update LANG <-> layout mappings from localization-config-0.102.

  * Set default keyboard model to pc105 for powerpc. (Closes: 1690)

xfree86 (4.3.0.dfsg.1-6ubuntu19) warty; urgency=low

  Imported from Debian: (Closes: #1390, #1506)

  * Grab /etc/X11/xkb/symbols/pc/us_intl from XFree86 CVS (2003-10-04).  This
    makes us_intl multi-layout aware, and binds the right Meta key to
    Mode_Switch.  (Closes: #271326, #234085)

  * Revert upstream change to altwin behavior applied in 4.3.0.dfsg.1-1.
    The Meta_* keysyms must be removed from the shift level of Alt keys when
    altwin:meta_win or altwin:left_meta_win are used; otherwise, XKB-unaware
    applications (like GNU Emacs) may believe that mod1 and mod4 are bound to
    Meta keys.

  * Fix inconsistencies in rules/xfree86* files:
    + rules/xfree86: List in $oldlayouts all layouts which are currently not
      multi-layout aware in the Debian xlibs package, including hu_US (thanks,
      Veres Lajos).  (Closes: #247463, #270810)
    + rules/xfree86: Support the lv3:ralt_switch option, which exists in
      xfree86.lst but was forgotten in this file.
    + rules/xfree86: Remove special case that causes PC keyboard models with
      the us_intl layout to load the us layout and add the us_intl layout to
      it.  (Closes: #234085)
    + rules/xfree86.{lst,xml}: Replace the options altwin:meta_super and
      altwin:meta_hyper with the correct names altwin:super_win and
      altwin:hyper_win.  (Closes: #271259)
    + rules/xfree86.{lst,xml}: Synchronize these files.

  * Add FAQ entry: My keyboard configuration worked with XFree86 4.2; why is
    it messed up now?  (Closes: #259740)

  * Lower "Use Kernel Frambuffer" priority to medium.
  * Do not ask for video card driver. If we cannot autodetect, we
    switch automatically to a sane default.
  * Rewrote the monitor detection section based on Daniel Stone
    xresprobe package.
  * Add synaptic touchpad mouse entry if we are on laptop.
  * Add JEFFCRACK in dexconf.

    + OFFICIAL_BUILD:="yes"
    + BUILDER_EMAIL_ADDR:=fabbione@fabbione.net
    + IMAKE_DEFINES s/Debian/Ubuntu

  * Switch defaults to always attempt autodetection.
    (debian/xserver-xfree86.config)

  * Always ask for X keyboard layout while we wait for automagic to be
    in place. (debian/xserver-xfree86.config)

  * Add notes on part of the code where we need autodetection improvements.
    (debian/xserver-xfree86.config)

  * Switch default monitor selection method to "Medium" in case autodetection
    fails. (debian/xserver-xfree86.config)

  * Enable 1024x768 in DEFAULT_MODES. Anybody using 800x600 on a desktop?
    (debian/xserver-xfree86.config)

  * Make xbase-clients declare that it replaces xutils (<< 4.3.0.dfsg.1-6ubuntu1)
    and viceversa. See below.

  * Change default "your monitor's best video mode" down to 1024x768 @ 60Hz
    from 1280x960 @ 60Hz. Let's try to not fry old laptops.
    (xserver-xfree86.templates xserver-xfree86/config/monitor/mode-list)

  * Redirect all buildlogs and installogs in logs/.

  * Upload urgency set to medium due to fix for stable-release-critical bugs
    (#285133 and #285150; see below).

  * Make keypad delete key <KPDL> generate KP_Separator, not comma, in

    (Closes: #286667)

  Changes by Branden Robinson:

  * Update Turkish debconf template translations (thanks, Recai Oktas).
    (Closes: #256360)

  * Grab latest version of XTerm (#191) from Thomas Dickey's website.

  * Add FAQ entry: Why is xterm using the "fixed" font for everything,
    disregarding the font configuration from the X resource database?
    (Closes: #254650)

  * Update hyperlink to Debian X FAQ in NEWS file.  Thanks to Calum Mackay for
    pointing this out.

  * Make libxpm-dev rather than xlibs-static-dev provide libxpm4-dev.
    Thanks to Daniel Schelper for pointing this out.  (Closes: #256420)

  * Move atobm and its manpage from xutils to xbase-clients; this shuts up
    dangling symlink warning mails from cron on systems with xutils installed
    but not xbase-clients.  Make xbase-clients declare that it replaces xutils
    (<< 4.3.0.dfsg.1-7).  (Closes: #200061)

  * Invert the sense of a test in debian/rules; this results in xlibmesa-dri's
    bug script actually being shipped.  D'oh!

  * Make xbase-clients depend on xlibs and explain why in the package's
    extended description.  Thanks to Andreas Metzler for catching this.
    (Closes: #257023)

  * Update FAQ entry "How do I run an X client as root when the X session
    is run by a user?" to document existence of sux.

  * Update Glide3 library support for amd64 and ia64 thanks to Guillem Jover.
    Increment versioned build-dependency on libglide3 to >= 2002.04.10-7, and
    require this library for building on amd64 and ia64.  Edit patch #003 to
    enable compilation of tdfx DRI Mesa module on amd64 and ia64.  Shut up cpp
    warnings when generating Makefiles by defining a default value for
    HasGlide3 in xfree86.cf ("NO").  Resync patches #004, #048, #103, #150,
    #250, #500, and #600.  Ship tdfx DRI Mesa module in xlibmesa-dri for amd64
    and ia64, and unstripped version of same in xlibmesa-dri-dbg.
    (Closes: #255270)

  * Fix up Glide3 library support in various respects.  Stop shipping tdfx DRI
    Mesa module on powerpc until it stops being useless (i.e., until
    libglide3-dev is available on that architecture).  Move xlibmesa-gl's
    suggestion of the libglide3 package (and explanation thereof) to the
    xlibmesa-dri package.

  * Add FAQ entry: I'm having trouble getting dual-head support to work on my
    ATI Radeon card.  Can you help?  (Closes: #236197)

  * Update FAQ to include hyperlink to the upstream source for the XTerm FAQ.

  * Grab latest version of XTerm (#192) from Thomas Dickey's website.
    According to the upstream changelog, this release addresses several Debian
    bugs.
    + Change resource settings for color4 and color12; add some discussion in
      XTerm-col.ad.  (Closes: #255070)
    + Add a note in xterm manpage regarding possible conflict between resource
      settings for xterm.vt100.font and xterm.vt100.utf8Fonts.font.
      (See #254650.)
    + Add case to uxterm to accommodate locales ending with "@euro", e.g.,
      fr_FR.UTF-8@euro (report/analysis by Matthieu Lagouge).
      (Closes: #255197)
    + Save the fontnames for bold fonts that are derived from normal fonts, or
      from the boldFont resource, so the same value is restored when switching
      with the VT Fonts menu.  (Closes: #256086)
    + Fix typo in manpage's description of character classes.
      (Closes: #257073)
    + Modify terminfo to accommodate luit, which relies on G1 being used via
      an ISO-2022 escape sequence (analysis by Juliusz Chrobocek).
      (See #254316; in Debian, this is actually an ncurses-base bug.)

  * Update XTerm FAQ to latest version (1.84) from Thomas Dickey's website.

  * Grab from XFree86 CVS (no later than 2003-11-10) several fixes to the
    RandR extension manual page and server-side implementation.
    + Remove reference to non-existent Xrender(3) man page (reported to
      webmaster).  [David Dawes]
    + Fix manual pages typos (Bugzilla #316, Jens Schweikhardt).  [Matthieu
      Herrb]
    + Removed Copyright sign from man pages as this causes some formatters to
      choke (Egbert Eich).
    + Fixed rounding of refresh rate in RandR, updated Xrandr man page
      (BugzillaR #527, Egbert Eich).
    + Fix RandR initialization problem when default screen resolution is
      different from the virtual resolution. (Bugzilla #853, Bob Paauwe).
      [Alan Hourihane]
    + The call to xf86RandRSetMode() from xf86RandRCreateScreenResources()
      doesn't appear to be necessary.  Removing it restores the documented
      ViewPort behaviour when RandR is enabled (David Dawes).
    + Warning fix [Marc Aurele La France]
    + C-style comments were being stripped by preprocessing.  [David Dawes]
    (Closes: #256297)

  * Fix bug in COMPOUND_TEXT translation of the GBK character encoding
    (thanks, Su Yong).  (Closes: #255224)

  * Fix missing element of Debian X FAQ conversion to XHTML; correct
    s390-specific version of xfree86-common dh_installdocs file to recognize
    that the FAQ is already gzipped.

  * Move BDF font character set conversion files from xfonts-base package to
    xutils (these files are used and needed by the ucs2any tool in the latter
    package, and not by anything else).  Update MANIFEST and .install files
    accordingly.  Make xutils declare that it replaces xfonts-base (<<
    4.3.0.dfsg.1-7).

  * Rewrite and greatly enhance manifest-install-reconcile tool to be able to
    check against lists of known false positives and false negatives on a
    per-architecture basis.  Ship these lists, add a usage message to
    manifest-install-reconcile, and document use of the script in the README
    file.

  * Grab from XFree86 CVS (no later than 2003-12-18) fixes to the ja_JP.UTF-8,
    ko_KR.UTF-8, and zh_TW.UTF-8 XLC_LOCALE files to prefer ISO
    10646-1-encoded fonts less strongly.  Add zh_CN.UTF-8 XLC_LOCALE file.
    Update MANIFEST and .install files accordingly.  (Closes: #255701)

  * Provide local, hacked version of debconf-updatepo (in debian/scripts) that
    doesn't destroy the comment and header block of debian/po/templates.pot.
    Add "pristine" comment and header file in debian/po, add debian/rules
    targets to handle PO and POT file updates using our local script, and
    document the recommended procedure in debian/README.  Hopefully the real
    debconf-updatepo will be fixed soon.

  * Update debian/po/*.{po,pot} files to update comment header and get effects
    of a debconf-updatepo bugfix which misidentified template types in some
    situations.

  * Update Czech debconf template translations (thanks, Miroslav Kure).
    (Closes: #260868)

  * Update German debconf template translations (thanks, Florian Ernst and
    Alwin Meschede).  (Closes: #261239)

  * Update Dutch debconf template translations (thanks, Bart Cornelis).
    (Closes: #261337)

  * Update Brazilian Portuguese debconf template translations (thanks, AndrÃ©
    LuÃ­s Lopes). (Closes: #261389)

  * Apply patch from Thomas Dickey to fix Imake's CppRawFileTarget() so that
    it no longer tempts cpp into corrupting manpages.  Thanks, Thomas!
    (Closes: #259996)

  * Update hurd-i386 support.
    + Update gnu.cf to declare platform support for groff, libpng, and PAM
      libraries in parity with Linux; also specify correct path to cpp
      executable.
    + Tell XTerm's Imakefile that openpty() needs -lutil on GNUArchitecture
      (patch #803).
    + Disable special hostname registration code for __GNU__ in xdm (patch
      #804).
    + Update MANIFEST.hurd-i386.in in light of updates to build configuration.
    + Remove MANFIEST.hurd-i386.all; it is no longer needed.
    + Update mir-false-negatives and mir-false-positives to reflect changes in
      MANIFEST files.
    (Thanks, Michael Banck!)

  * Grab from XFree86 CVS (2003-05-29) a fix for a SEGV in libX11's lcPrTxt()
    function, which caused application crashes when, e.g., pasting text into
    XTerm.  Also remove patch #051 in favor of identical fix committed to
    XFree86 CVS on 2003-04-03.  Thanks to Thomas Dickey for tracking this
    bug, and fix, down.  (Closes: #250655)

  * Expand, correct, and tidy up the setxkbmap(1x), xkbcomp(1x), xkbevd(1x),
    and xkbprint(1x) manpages; also correct typos in xkbcomp's README.config
    file (patch #051).  (Closes: #255371)

  * Perform major stylistic fixes to the XF86Config-4(5x) manpage, greatly
    expand its cross-reference section to mention all shipped section 4x
    manpages (e.g. radeon(4x)), and fix some typos (patch #099e).
    (Closes: #257440)

  * Update manpage cross-references to refer to XF86Config-4(5x) instead of
    XF86Config(5x), and add brief explanatory note to top of XF86Config-4(5x)
    (patch #911).

  * Update FAQ to split off some of existing entry "Why are some fonts (or
    graphical rulers) sized incorrectly?" into new question "How do I set the
    DPI (dots-per-inch) value used by the X server?".

  * Grab fix from XFree86 CVS (2003-05-07) to bounds problems in *scanf(),
    snprintf() and strncpy() calls in lbxproxy, makepsres, and xedit.

  * Tighten regex in patch-audit rule so messages like "patching file
    xc/doc/man/Xt/XtOffset.man" are not false positives.

  * Grab from XFree86 CVS (2003-05-29) a boatload of typographical fixes to
    manual pages.  Resync and make further corrections to manpages in patches
    #026 (appres, ico) and #051 (setxkbmap, xkbcomp, xkbevd, xkbprint).
    Resync patches #032, #099e, #911.

  * Grab from XFree86 CVS (2003-07-16) more updates to the nv driver.  Fixes
    several bugs as well as adding support for several chipsets, including
    GeForce FX 5600SE, GeForce FX Go5600, GeForce FX Go5650, Quadro FX Go700,
    GeForce FX Go5100, GeForce FX 5900 Ultra, GeForce FX 5900, Quadro FX 3000,
    and the "mystery" TNT2 card with a PCI model ID of 0x002a.  Extend
    reversion of REGION_EQUAL macro implementation to nv driver in patch #030.
    Resync patch #911.

  * Grab from XFree86 CVS (2003-07-07) more updates to the trident driver,
    placing them in their own patch file.  Fixes several bugs and adds support
    for TV chipsets VT1621 and CH7005.  Drop trident driver patches in
    #000_stolen_from_HEAD in favor of new patch file.  Extend reversion of
    REGION_EQUAL macro implementation to trident driver in patch #030.  Resync
    patch #911.

  * Change Catalan debconf template translations to use the characters "LATIN
    SMALL LETTER L" and "MIDDLE DOT" instead of "LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH
    MIDDLE DOT" so that the file can be successfully transcoded to ISO
    8859-15, shutting up hateful noise from one of the programs called by
    dh_installdebconf (thanks, Guillem Jover).

  * Grab from XFree86 CVS (2003-10-02) several updates to the mouse input
    driver, fixing bugs and adding support for the Kensington
    "ValuMouseScroll" protocol.  Grab an additional fix from XFree86 CVS
    (2003-12-08) for mouse wheel misbehavior on PowerPC.  Resync patches #040
    and #097.  Add "ValuMouseScroll" to the list of supported serial mouse
    protocols in xserver-xfree86's configuration script.

  * Grab from XFree86 CVS (2003-10-02) several bugfixes to xedit, including a
    fix for a SEGV in Lisp_New().  Move existing xedit patches from XFree86
    CVS to their own patch file.  (Closes: #257835)

  * Major housecleaning of X11's locale support (patch #011a).
    + Add all locales supported by version 2.3.2 of the GNU C Library except
      zh_CN.GB18030, sq_AL.ISO-8859-1, and tg_TJ.KOI8-T.  X has no support for
      the GB18030 and KOI8-T character sets, and glibc appears to disagree
      with most of the world about which character set Albanians use (see, for
      example, iso_8859-2(7)).  This baka gaijin has learned his lesson about
      trying to report l10n bugs in glibc, so I'll let someone else do the
      jousting.  :-P
    + Synchronize compose.dir with locale.dir wherever possible (i.e.,
      wherever compose tables exist) so that as many supported locales as
      possible get a Compose map.  Comment out references to compose tables
      that don't actually exist.
    + Disable support for iu_CA.NUNACOM-8.  X11 doesn't have any support for
      the NUNACOM-8 character set.  (iu_CA.UTF-8 is still supported.)
    + Disable support for locales that are neither supported by the GNU C
      Library, nor use standard ISO 639 language or 3166 territory codes.
      This includes Esperanto (eo_EO, eo_XX), and what I presume is
      Pennsylvania "Dutch" (pd_DE, pd_US).
    + Turn off intrusion of Nynorsk into Nyanja's ISO 639 space.  (Nynorsk is
      nn, not ny.)
    + Retain support for a3 as an alias for az (Azerbaijani), though I'm
      dubious about it.
    + Turn off support for the bogus (and ancient) FreeBSD-ism of using
      "lt_LN.ISO8859-1" as a "generic" Latin-1 locale.
    + Remove bogus "ee" locales for Estonian (et).
    + Remove ISO 8859-15 support for languages that don't use that character
      set according to glibc.
    + Alias "fi" and "fi_FI" to use ISO 8859-1, not ISO 8859-15, for
      compatiblity with glibc (thanks, Jukka Suomela).  (Closes: #266834)
    + Remove @euro modifier support from locales that don't use that currency
      (i.e., countries not in the Euro zone).
    + Ensure we support the @euro modifier for all locales that use it
      (according to glibc), even if the codeset is explicitly specified.  See
      Debian #208137.
    + Rewrite some comments to be in grammatical English.
    + Add locale-munger script, which I used to gather the information that
      drove these changes.
    + Resync patch #096.
    + Fix a few Debian bugs in the process:
      - en_GB.ISO-8859-15 is now supported.  (Closes: #122039)
      - et_EE.ISO-8859-15 is now supported.  (Closes: #258223)
      - sv_SE.ISO-8859-15 is now supported.  (Closes: #243237)

  * Apply patch to savage driver to turn off RandR extension when driver's
    "Rotate" option is used, preventing screen garbling (patch #099f; thanks,
    Jorg Schuler).  Update manpage to document this fact.  Resync patch #911.
    (Closes: #258986)

  * Fix wrong comment character in Debian customizations to XTerm application
    defaults file.  (Closes: #252274)

  * Grab from freedesktop.org CVS a fix for SEGVs in the chips driver when the
    current mode wasn't valid.  Thanks to Ryan Underwood for identifying and
    testing this fix.  Resync patches #044 and #045.  (Closes: #260753)

  * Make keypad delete key <KPDL> generate KP_Separator, not KP_Decimal, in
    Polish XKB layouts (thanks, Emil Novak).  (Closes: #261163)

  * Grab latest version of Thomas Winischhofer's SiS driver for the XFree86 X
    server from his website as of 2004-08-20.  Resync patch #911.
    + Circumvent unresolved symbol complaints by explicitly loading the "glx"
      module when DRI is used.  (Closes: #254601)

  * Fix up the Mesa DRI tdfx module so that it really does use only libglide3,
    not libglide3-dev (#099h).  Open the actual libglide shared library we
    need, not the symbolic link used at compile time, which may not be
    installed on non-development systems.  When opening chipset-specific glide
    libraries, use the filenames actually in use by the current version of the
    libglide3 package.  Thanks to Guillem Jover for this patch.
    (Closes: #260099)

  * Update "Why does the X server take up so much memory?" FAQ entry with
    information from Albert Cahalan about how I/O is charged to processes in
    the procps utilities (he says it actually isn't).  Also add description of
    xrestop package and utility.

  * Overhaul dexconf.
    + Drop support for XFree86 3.x X server format.
    + Drop support for -f, --format and -s, --stdout options.
    + Use exec and open file descriptor 4 for output, instead of repetitiously
      redirecting standard output to a file explicitly all the time.  We can't
      use fd 3 since debconf uses it.
    + Use here documents a little more, and printf a little less.
    + Put blank lines between XF86Config-4 sections so that the file is easier
      to read.
    + Overwrite the destination file instead of "mv"ing or "cp"ing it; this
      way it is never unlinked.  (The maintainer scripts implement enough
      paranoia already.)
    + Tidy up shell style.
    + Modernize dexconf(1) manual page to undocument obsolete options, replace
      the "FUTURE DIRECTIONS" section with "HISTORY", correct and update
      "DIAGNOSTICS" section, provide more cross-references, and put a newline
      at the end of every sentence in the document source (per the GNU Roff
      texinfo documentation).
    + Use -o instead of -s and redirection when invoking dexconf from
      xserver-xfree86's postinst script, since the -s option is no longer
      supported.
    + WARNING: xserver-xfree86{,-dbg} 4.3.0.dfsg.1-[56] are not compatible with
      this version of xserver-common, or planned future versions, due to the
      above-mentioned removal of dexconf's -s option.  At the same time,
      saying xserver-common 4.3.0.dfsg.1-7 conflicts: xserver-xfree86
      (<< 4.3.0.dfsg.1-7) and xserver-xfree86-dbg (<< 4.3.0.dfsg.1-7) is
      excessive because 4.3.0.dfsg.1-4 and earlier will work.  I have heard
      that stating such a conflict can make things difficult for apt's
      problem resolver (or even impossible, if in conjunction with enough
      other versioned dependency or conflicts), so the risk seems greater than
      the reward.  It's too bad we don't have a way to conflict on ranges that
      aren't bounded on either zero or infinity.  Given that 4.3.0.dfsg.1-[56]
      have never appeared even in sarge, I'm making this judgement call.  Any
      bugs about this will be closed with this changelog entry included,
      unless you can rebut my premises; i.e., "I am Jason Gunthorpe and I
      declare that apt can eat a stack of versioned conflicts like this for
      breakfast and still see the One True Upgrade Path!", or "You silly
      person, of *course* dpkg and apt accept 'Conflicts: (4.3.0.dfsg.1-4 <<)
      xserver-xfree86 (<< 4.3.0.dfsg.1-7)'!"

  Changes by Fabio M. Di Nitto and Branden Robinson:

  * Support building only the parts of the source tree needed by
    architecture-specific packages.
    + Modify Debian Imake configuration to support building with fonts and
      specs docs turned off (patch #003).  Resynchronize GNU/Hurd,
      GNU/FreeBSD, and GNU/NetBSD Imake configurations with Debian
      configuration (patches #800, #820, #842, #900).  Resync diffs in patches
      #004, #099c, #600.
    + Modify Imakefiles to build and install the font utilities even if the
      fonts themselves are not being shipped (patch #095).
    + Make the "build" target a dummy target, replacing it with
      "build-arch-only" and "build-all" targets.  Target-specific variable
      values are used to invoke a "real-build" target, turning off the
      building of fonts and "specs docs" as needed.
    + Add comments to rules file, update $(stampdir_targets) and .PHONY
      target.
    + Split MANIFEST files into arch-specific and arch-independent parts.
      Update the README to explain how these files work now and how to update
      them.
    + Ship the XTerm control sequences document only in the xspecs package.
    Consequences:
    + Reduce the disk space required to build the package by ~520MB when the
      "binary-arch" target is used (e.g., by "dpkg-buildpackage -B".)
    + Reduce the build time by 20 to 30 percent when the "binary-arch" target
      is used (ccache users might see even more improvement).
    + Make the buildd admins hate us less.

  * Rewrite migration of app-defaults (in libxt6) and xkb (in libx11-6)
    directories.
    + Enhance the shell libary with new functions:
      - Implement check_symlink() and change check_symlinks_and_warn() and
        check_symlinks_and_bomb() to use it.
      - Implement make_symlink_sane().  Ensure that the specified symbolic
        link symlink exists, and points to the specified target.  If symlink
        does not exist, create it and point it at target.  If symlink exists
        but is not a symbolic link, back it up.  If symlink exists, is a
        symbolic link, but points to the wrong location, fix it.  If symlink
        exists, is a symbolic link, and already points to target, do nothing.
        This function wouldn't be needed if ln had an -I, --idempotent option.
      - Implement migrate_dir_to_symlink().  Per Debian Policy section 6.5.4,
        "A directory will never be replaced by a symbolic link to a directory
        or vice versa; instead, the existing state (symlink or not) will be
        left alone and dpkg will follow the symlink if there is one."  We have
        to do it ourselves.  This function moves the contents of old_location,
        a directory, into new_location, a directory, then makes old_location a
        symbolic link to new_location.  old_location need not exist, but if it
        does, it must be a directory (or a symlink to a directory).  If it is
        not, it is backed up.  If new_location exists already and is not a
        directory, it is backed up.
    + Add config scripts for libx11-6 and libxt6, which detect if
      /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/{app-defaults,xkb} is a directory but not a symlink,
      and use debconf to prompt the user (at low priority) whether the
      directories should be moved.  If the user says no, abort the script.  If
      the user says yes (default), start the migration with
      migrate_dir_to_symlink().
    + Update preinst scripts to use debconf as the configs script do; this is
      unusual but necessary because if we're going to do the migration we need
      to start before any other packages (which may use the old directories)
      are unpacked.
    + In the preinst scripts, call check_symlink(), and if that fails, call
      make_symlink_sane().  Stop calling check_symlinks_and_warn().
    + Update postinst scripts to indicate that migration is completed.
    + Update postrm scripts to run migration in reverse if it had been started
      and the package installation or upgrade is aborted.
    + We keep shipping /etc/X11/{app-defaults,xkb} symlinks as part of the
      package payloads, because manipulating them in the preinst isn't enough
      -- dpkg will remove "disappearing" files from the system *after* the
      preinst runs but before the postinst does, leaving a window for packages
      using the legacy paths to unpack to the old location with no symlink to
      redirect them, which is precisely what we don't want (see section 6.5 of
      the Debian Policy Manual).

  * Make xserver-xfree86 config script's validate_monitor_frequency_db_input()
    function more strict, so it doesn't regard open-ended ranges like "40-" as
    valid.

  * Fix some lingering references to an unreleased version of xserver-common
    in the debian/control file; bump the versioning up to the subsequent
    package release.

  Changes by Robert Millan:

  * Get glxinfo to link properly with g++ (instead of adding -lstdc++).

  Changes by Fabio M. Di Nitto:

  * Fix default drivers lists in xserver-xfree86.config.in. The via driver is
    only available for hurd-i386 and i386.

  * Fix bug in xserver-xfree86 configuration script where failure of
    autodetection would cause the script to think it had detected one X server
    or XFree86 video driver instead ($(echo "" | wc -l) is "1", not "0").

  * Add French and Danish translation of "Generic Monitor" to
    xserver-xfree86.config.in.  Thanks to Christian Perrier and Anders Dybdal.

  * Add Danish translation of "Generic Video Card" to
    xserver-xfree86.config.in.  Thanks to Anders Dybdal.

  Changes by Denis Barbier:

  * Grab from XFree86 CVS (no later than 2003-12-18) several fixes to XKB:
    + Fix for XKB map 'altwin' to avoid one keysym to more than one modifier
      mapping (Ivan Pascal).  This really fixes the Alt-Tab issue.
      (Closes: #256706)
    + Fix xmodmap's output of the modifiers map to not display BadKey when
      the first column keysym is empty (Ivan Pascal).
    + The "modifier_add none" construct was introduced by Ivan Pascal some
      times ago, but it was not documented in the changelog and a piece was
      missing to enable this feature.  No keymaps currently use this feature,
      but users may find it useful with broken keymaps.
