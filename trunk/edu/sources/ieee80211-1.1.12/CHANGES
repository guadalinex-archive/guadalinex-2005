  netdev-2.6#upstream

Changes in 1.1.5

* Lindent and trailing whitespace script executed ieee80211 subsystem
* When an assoc_resp is received the network structure is not completely
  initialized which can cause problems for drivers that expect the 
  network structure to be completely filled in (thanks to Ivo van Doorn)
* Currently the info_element is parsed by 2 seperate functions, this
  results in a lot of duplicate code. (thanks to Ivo van Doorn)
* Fix implicit nocast warnings in ieee80211 code:
  net/ieee80211/ieee80211_tx.c:215:9: warning: implicit cast to nocast 
  type (thanks to Randy Dunlap)
* Move the ieee80211_is_ofdm_rate function to the ieee80211.h
  header, and I also added the ieee80211_is_cck_rate counterpart (thanks 
  to Ivo van Doorn)

  (thanks to Michael Wu)
* Changed crypto method from requiring a struct ieee80211_device reference
  to the init handler.  Instead we now have a get/set flags method for
  each crypto component.
* Added handle_deauth() callback , enhanced tkip/ccmp support of varying 
  hw/sw offload.
* Fixed #768 Keep auth mode unchanged after iwconfig key off/on cycle
* Switched to sscanf in store_debug_level

Changes in 1.1.4

* Added WE-18 support to default wireless extension handler
* Updated compatibility version number since the ieee80211_device 
  change
* Added subsystem version string and reporting via MODULE_VERSION and
  printk during load.
* Updated copyright dates.
* Updated based on Michael Wu's patch and comments sent to netdev:
	+ Added IE comments to ieee80211_* frame structures.
	+ Changed reason_code to reason (consistency)
* [Bug 768] Keep auth mode unchanged after iwconfig key off/on cycle.
* Mixed PTK/GTK CCMP/TKIP support.

* Added ERP IE parsing to ieee80211_rx
* Added handle_probe_request callback.
* Removed "extern inline" (thanks to Adrian Bunk)
* Additional fixes for endian-aware types (based in part on Michael Wu's 
  changes)
* Added ieee80211_radiotap.h to enhance statistic reporting to user space
  from wireless drivers (thanks to Mike Kershaw)
* Added ieee80211_geo to provide helper functions to drivers for
  implementing supported channel maps.
* Add QoS (WME) support to the ieee80211 subsystem.
* Per the conversations with folks at OLS, the QoS layer in 802.11
  drivers can now result in NETDEV_TX_BUSY being returned when the queue
  a packet is targetted for is full.
* Fixed TKIP encryption issues msdu + mpdu encryption on every
  fragment. Change the behavior to msdu encryption on the whole
  packet, then mpdu encryption on every fragment.
* Modified to avoid repeated fragmentation when !host_encrypt.
* Added ieee80211_tx_frame to convert generic 802.11 data frames into
  txbs for transmission.
* Added several purpose specific callbacks (handle_assoc, handle_auth,
  etc.) which the driver can register with for being notified on
  reception of variouf frame elements.
* Added support for the creation of RTS packets when the
  config flag CFG_IEEE80211_RTS has been set (thanks to Ivo van Doorn)

Changes in 1.0.3

* Cleaned up some prior merge regressions when syncing with 
  netdev-2.6
* Fixed some whitespace issues.
* Removed some un-needed comments.
* Removed duplicate defines, for example:
	IEEE80211_DATA_HDR4_LEN => IEEE80211_4ADDR_LEN

Changes in 1.0.2

* Fix type-o: abg_ture -> abg_true (thanks to Hong Liu)
* Fix 64-bit warnings (thanks to Pedro Ramalhais)
* Fix to refernce of skb->priority after skb freed (thank to Zhu Yi)
* Fixed Makefile's check_old to look in correct path for .config and 
  include/linux/autoconf.h (thanks to Pedro Ramalhais)

Changes in 1.0.1

* Updated to latest ieee80211-dev work (compatible with ipw-dev tree, 
  ipw2100 1.1.1, and ipw2200 1.0.5)
* Modified ieee80211_geo to start adding more geographies and to correct 
  an 802.11h mapping problem.
* Added WE18 support (thanks to Hong Liu)
* memcpy() parameter reversal fix (thanks to akamatsu)
* Fixed compatibility problem with kernel due to multiple definitions of 
  is_multicast_ether_addr()
* Modified 'make check' to be 'make check_old' so as not to conflict 
  with Gentoo's Portage system.
* Fix TKIP encryption and fragmentation code rewrite (thanks to Hong Liu)
* Add ieee->host_encrypt_msdu to avoid ipw specific change in ieee80211.
* Sync with netdev-2.6 ieee80211 branch.

Changes in 1.0.0

  stand alone project; compatible with ipw2100 1.1.0 and ipw2200 1.0.0
