Description: Source for the 802.11 (wireless) network stack for Linux
 This package provides the source code for the 802.11 (wireless) network
 stack module for the Linux kernel. Though it has been incorporated in
 latest kernel versions, the bundled one might not be up-to-date to build
 third-party wireless modules such as ipw2100 or ipw2200 which are common
 on Centrino notebooks.
 .
 In order to compile these modules you need the kernel sources (or the
 kernel-headers for the kernel-image packages from Debian). For compile
 instructions look into /usr/share/doc/ieee80211-source/README.Debian or
 simply use the module-assistant utility.
