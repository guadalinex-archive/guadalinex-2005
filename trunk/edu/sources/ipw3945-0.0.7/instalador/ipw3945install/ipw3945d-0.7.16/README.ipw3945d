Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection 
Regulatory Daemon README.ipw3945d

ABOUT

The regulatory daemon is responsible for controlling and configuring 
aspects of the hardware required to operate the device within 
compliance of various regulatory agencies.  This includes controlling 
which channels are allowed to do active/passive scanning, transmit 
power levels, which channels are allowed to be transmitted on, and 
support for IEEE 802.11h (DFS and TPC).


INSTALLATION 

Within this archive are two directories, x86 and x86_64.  Depending on 
the architecture you are using, chose the appropriate ipw3945d 
regulatory daemon and install it into your system, typically in /sbin.

For example:

If you are running on a 32-bit system, you would perform the following:

% cp x86/ipw3495d /sbin

If you are running on an EM64T enabled system, you would perform the 
following:

% cp x86_64/ipw3945d /sbin

You may need to be root to copy the file to that location.  You will 
need to be root to run the file.

The scripts provided with the Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network 
Connection driver for Linux requires the regulatory daemon to be in the 
current execution path, or to use the -ipw3945d parameter (see the 
README.ipw3945 provided with the driver package.)
