Changes in 0.0.70

* Modified rate scaling to not send an unnecessary command to the
  microcode every time the rate changes.
* Modified the Tx measurement code to only gather statistics once every
  3 seconds vs. every time a packet exceeds a given size (relative to 
  the rate used)
* Modified Tx measurement code to disable BT priority for those Tx 
  requests where measurements are being requested.

Changes in 0.0.69

* Fixed #295 Removed BUG_ON(!spin_is_locked(&priv->daemon_lock)) code 
  as spin_is_locked is always 0 on UP and non-debug kernels.

Changes in 0.0.68

* Updated README.ipw3945:
	- Power Managment section reflect actual operation of the 
	  driver.
	- Updated IEEE 802.11h information
	- Updated 'channels' information in sysfs section
* Fixed copyright date in driver #define to 2006 (from 2004)
* Fixed driver name.
* Updated ucode and regulatory daemon version strings in documentation.

Changes in 0.0.67

* First version posted to SourceForge
* Changed QoS module parameters to all have the qos_ prefix.
* Updated INSTALL and REAMDE.ipw3945 documents.
* Moved CONFIG_IPW_MONITOR -> CONFIG_IPW3945_MONITOR
* Moved reset priv out of CONFIG_IPW3945_MONITOR mode ifdef's

Changes in 0.66

* Fix #279 problem with driver not supporting BG SKU by adding support for 
  BG SKUs with the following PCI ID (device:subsystem)

    0x4222:0x1005
    0x4222:0x1034
    0x4227:0x1014
    0x4222:0x1044

  If a card is detected as ABG (its PCI ID is not one of the above) and 
  the EEPROM does not enable any A band channels, it will be treated as 
  a BG SKU and an informational message will be displayed to the kernel 
  log.
* Fix #267 problem with comapre_ether_addr being redefined by ipw3945 
  after ieee80211 has already done so on kernels older than 2.6.15

Changes in 0.65

* Fix #260 problem with frames setting PM bit even after power 
  saving mode has been disabled.
* Updated documentation to fix #172, #180, #189, #124, and #249
* Fix #264 problem with first load after a restart 
  potentially causing the intial load to be delayed due to 
  the NIC not being active when it an attempt is made to 
  take it down:
	- Changed !(priv->status & STATUS_INIT) -> ipw_is_alive
	- Changed ipw_is_init -> ipw_is_alive 
	- Changed STATUS_INIT -> STATUS_ALIVE
	- Added STATUS_INIT to indicate if ipw_nic_init was called
	- Added check in ipw_down for whether STATUS_INIT is set
* Fix #265 problem with suspend while associated 
  periodically causing a kernel panic.

  parameter resulting in a BUG_ON.
* Fixed #252 problem with driver not being able to fully 
  re-initialize itself when loaded.
* Removed printk_buf from non-debug builds

Changes in 0.62

* Fixed problem with maximum txpower limit being set to 0, which keeps 
  iwconfig txpower from functioning.

  the hardware is reporting valid temperature readings.

* Fixed #127 problem with associating with 802.11a APs that have the 
  spectrum management bit set but were not providing Power Constraint 
  and TPC report information elements.

  firmware errors.
* Fixed #132 stack usage problem.  Any function using > 300 
  bytes of stack space was modified to use less stack space.  
  The largest stack usage is now < 300 bytes.
* Fixed #128 and #157 problems with noise stats being dropped 
  to 0 if CCK probe frame is receivd on an OFDM network.

  completed execution before unloading the driver module.
* Added code to force all driver entry points to immediately return if 
  a driver shutdown is in progress

  command completion callback kicked in (recursive dead lock)
* Added code to abort a ipw_daemon_send_cmd() if an unload is initiated

Changes in 0.57

* Fixed possible problem with DAEMON_READ_TIMEOUT length not being
  initialized if compiled with certain versions of gcc; symptom is
  the message 'read mistmatch: RANDOM NUMBER (expected) !=0' in the
  ipw3945d daemon debug log (originally listed as fixed in 0.55, but 
  not actually merged into code).
* Possible fix for spin_lock dead lock during heavy Tx activity
* Fixed problem with sending daemon Tx measured status even on on Tx 
  failures

Changes in 0.56

* Fixed #242 problem with firmware restarts in 802.11a mode
* Added Tx rate information to the Tx daemon status sync.

Changes in 0.55

* Fixed #195 problem with iwconfig txpower not setting or reporting the
  configured Tx power correctly.  Documented the expected behavior in 
  README.ipw3945.

  reloading the driver.
* Fixed #190 problem with bitrate not being reported correctly as a 
  function of range
* Fixed #210 problem with PSP mode not working correctly in BSS mode 
  (not quite what the summary description of the bug was, but that's 
  where the bug fix led)
* Fixed #241 problem with 'Error sending DAEMON to daemon' message if
  you unload the driver while associated.

  is scheduled before a prior one has initialized the hardware.

  related bugs)

  back on
* Added plumbing for doing Tx measurement reporting from the driver to 
  the daemon.

Changes in 0.52

* Fixed load/unload scripts so they correctly pass parameters (unload 
  was resetting the driver and daemon arguments to an empty list at the 
  start of the load script)
* Fixed #102 problem with not being able to associate in Managed mode 
  after using Ad-Hoc mode
* Removed bit-field from being displayed via channels sysfs entry.
* Added spin_lock mutex around daemon user space and cross thread 
  communication constructs
* Fixed problem where if a scan abort is received after the microcode
  has completed scanning but before we have been notified, scanning 
  would no longer function.

Changes in 0.51

* First external release
* Cleaned up QoS code so it is all wrapped behind CONFIG_IPW3945_QOS

  files into the kernel tree.

Changes in 0.50

* Added 'patch_kernel' support to the Makefile so you can build and run 
  in-tree.
* Fixed problems with load and unload script not being able to find 
  ipw3945d in /sbin or via the -ipw3945d= load script parameter.
* Updated documentation on using -ipw394d= parameter

Changes in 0.49

* IRC only release to test the load / unload scripts.

Changes in 0.48

* Added synchronous daemon command capabilities
* Changed API for ipw_daemon_send_cmd() -- caller must allocate storage for 
  the daemon command.  Once called, ipw_daemon_cmd assumes control of the
  storage.  The caller must not free or reference the data once called, 
  regardless of ipw_daemon_send_cmd return code.
* Added daemonqueue as a 3rd execution thread.  This thread is scheduled
  to processes command requests from the daemon into the driver.
* Added DAEMON_CMD_DONE for the daemon to send results to the driver when
  a synchronous driver initiated command has completed.
* Moved post-calibration work to be scheduled to execute in priv->workqueue 
  vs. in the user thread used to call store_cmd().

Changes in 0.47

* Changed output of channels sysfs entry again.
* Fixed A and B rate scaling code
* Modified load and unload scripts to not specify the patch for ipw3945d 
  -- they should be installed somewhere in your path.  If you do not 
  have ipw3945d installed in your path, you can pass the -ipw3945d= 
  parameter to the load script to point to the directory where ipw3945d 
  can be located, for example:
	% ./load -ipw3945d=~/bin/ debug=0x43fff -- --log-file=ipw3945d.log
* Added daemon / driver version checking.

Changes in 0.46

* Changed sysfs channel output to be more compact and detail more info.

  etc.  

Changes in 0.45

* Fixed problem with not being able to associated with shared-key 
  authentication

  resulting in direct scans not working with some APs.

* Fixed problem with LED state not turning off if rf_kill asserted

Changes in 0.43

* Fixed problem with driver not compiling if WIRELESS_EXT < 18

  (introduced with 0.42)
* Added /sys/bus/pci/drivers/ipw3945/*/channels to provide a user 
  indication of which channels their SKU supports.

Changes in 0.42

* Fixed problem with background scans (scanning while associated) 
  periodically rendering the adapter inoperable (requiring reload)
* Fixed direct/indirect scan sequencing so that only a single scan pass
  is required per scan

  compiled out)

* Added TKIP countermeasure fixes based on code in more recent versions 
  of ipw2200

Changes in 0.38

* Fixed #200 problem with enabling LEDs causing a kernel oops on 
  association.  See README.ipw3945 for the intended behavior of the 
  LEDs.
* Fixed #203 problem with LEDs defaulting to being off.

Changes in 0.37

  limits.
* Added code to ignore receipt of multiple association requests if one 
  has already been processed for the current network.
