ISSUES
------------------------------

The following are the most common issues reported by users:


Driver performance is low

Work is being done to improve the over the air performance of the 
adapter.  Currently Tx data is measurably slower than it will be in the 
PV version.  Rx data is better than Tx, but still not ideal.


Can not associate with AP after being in an Ad-Hoc network

If you become a member of an Ad-Hoc network and then switch to Managed 
mode, you will not be able to associate with an access point.  You must 
reload the driver in order to associate to an AP in this situation.  
This will be fixed by the production version.


Can not do WPA with EAP w/ older wpa_supplicant versions

Users have reported problems using older (0.3.x) versions of 
wpa_supplicant with various authentication modes (WPA PSK, etc.).  
If you experience problems using wpa_supplicant, please upgrade to the 
latest version of the supplicant (0.4.6 or newer)


Problems with WPA with AES and fragmentation 

In some configurations, setting fragmentation on client results in 
AES not functioning.  If you experience this behavior, please try
with fragmentation disabled or check with your AP manufacturer for 
a firmware upgrade.
