_Description: Additional firmware needed
 The ipw3945 driver needs additional firmware to function properly.
 Presently you do not have the firmware installed on your system or the
 installed version does not match the requirements of this version of the
 ipw3945 driver.
 .
 The firmware is not provided as debian package, because the redistribution
 license does not allow for that. However the firmware can be downloaded
 for free from Intel's homepage. Please see
 /usr/share/doc/ipw3945-modules-${KVERS}/README.firmware for further
 instructions.
