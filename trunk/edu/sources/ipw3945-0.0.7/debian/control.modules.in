Description: ipw3945 modules for Linux (kernel _KVERS_).
 This package contains the set of loadable kernel modules for the
 Intel PRO/Wireless 3945 (IPW3945) mini PCI adapter, which is a common component
 of Centrino notebooks. Please note that you need additional firmware to use
 this driver. The firmware is freely available, please see
 /usr/share/doc/ipw3945-modules-_KVERS_ for details.
 .
 This package contains the compiled kernel modules for _KVERS_
 .
 If you have compiled your own kernel, you will most likely need to build
 your own ipw3945-modules.  The ipw3945-source package has been
 provided for use with the Debian kernel-package utility to produce a version
 of ipw3945-module for your kernel.
