.TH xdm.options 5 "2004\-04\-15" "Debian Project"
.SH NAME
xdm.options \- configuration options for X display manager
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I /etc/X11/xdm/xdm.options
contains a set of flags that determine some of the behavior of the
X display manager
.BR xdm (1x).
.PP
.I /etc/X11/xdm/xdm.options
may contain comments, which begin with a hash mark and end at the next
newline, just like comments in shell scripts.  The rest of the file
consists of options which are expressed as words separated by hyphens, with
only one option per line.  If an option is present with the \(oqno\-\(cq
prefix, or absent, it is disabled, otherwise it is considered enabled.
.PP
Available options are:
.TP
.B ignore\-nologin
Normally, the contents of the /etc/nologin file will be displayed using
.BR xmessage (1x)
(if
.B xmessage
is available), and the user will be returned to the xdm login screen after
the xmessage is dismissed.  If this option is enabled, xdm starts a session
as usual (after the xmessage is dismissed, if xmessage is available).
.TP
.B restart\-on\-upgrade
Enable this option with caution on \(oqproduction\(cq machines; it causes
the xdm daemon to be stopped and restarted on upgrade, even if the process
has children (which means it is managing X sessions).  Typically when a
package that contains a daemon is being installed or upgraded, its
maintainer scripts stop a running daemon process before installing the new
binary, and restart it after the new binary is installed.  Stopping xdm
causes immediate termination of any sessions it manages; in some situations
this could be an unwelcome surprise (for instance, for remote xdm users who
had no idea the administrator was performing system maintenance).  On the
other hand, for machines that stay up for long periods of time, leaving the
old daemon running can be a bad idea if the new version has, for instance,
a fix for a security vulnerability (overwriting xdm's executable on the
file system has no effect on the copy of xdm in memory).  The xdm
pre\-removal script checks to see if the xdm process has any children; if
it does, it is possible that someone's session would be killed by stopping
xdm, so a warning is issued and an opportunity to abort the upgrade of xdm
is provided.  Furthermore, restarting xdm on upgrade can be surprising,
because a locally\-managed X server can change the active VT even while
other packages are continuing to upgrade.  If, by intent or accident, the X
server does not honor the key sequence to switch VTs back to a virtual
console, this can be undesirable.  If this option is disabled (the Debian
default), xdm will be not be stopped or started during an upgrade of its
package; the administrator will have to do so by hand (with \(oqinvoke-rc.d
xdm restart\(cq, or by rebooting the system) before the newly installed xdm
binary is used.
.TP
.B start\-on\-install
Enable this option with caution; it causes the xdm daemon to be started
immediately after the package is installed.  See the above entry regarding
.B restart\-on\-upgrade
for other caveats regarding the consequences of starting the xdm daemon
during package management.  If this option is disabled (the Debian
default), xdm will not be started when it is installed.  Changing this
setting can affect future installs if the package is removed, but not
purged (which removes \(oqconffiles\(cq, including
.IR xdm.options ).
.TP
.B use\-sessreg
If this option is enabled (the Debian default), the sessreg program will be
invoked to register X sessions managed by xdm in the utmp and wtmp files.
Otherwise, it is not, and the utmp and wtmp files will have no record of
xdm sessions.
.PP
Users of older versions of the Debian system should note that the
\(oqrun\-xconsole\(cq option has been removed.  Shell scripts named
.I /etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup
and
.I /etc/X11/xdm/Xreset
can be edited to disable or modify the running of xconsole on the xdm
greeter screen; see the
.B xdm
manual page for more information.
