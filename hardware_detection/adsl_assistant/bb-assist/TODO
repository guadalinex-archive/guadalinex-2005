- Port redirection GUI on routers
- Better IP address and mask checks
- Check if the firmware of USB devices is present
- Encapsulation LLC is hard code in several places (br268ctl command, cmd-list.xml, etc).
- Better backend/frontend separation (with less privilegies for the UI)
- on_except in cmd-list.xsl is buggy. Maybe need a redefinition because it's not very used.
- and of course support more devices/providers.
