germinate (0.2) breezy; urgency=low

  * Fix formatting of output lines with UTF-8 maintainer strings.
  * Really pick the first reason from the build-dependency tree to display
    in output files.
  * Record allowed d-i kernel versions on a per-seed basis, so that we can
    have some kernel versions supported for netboot installations only.
  * Force a trailing slash onto the end of any --seed-source argument.
