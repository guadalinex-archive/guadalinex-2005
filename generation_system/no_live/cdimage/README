*** IMPORTANT, to generate the image you will need:

  - Fill the ftp/ dir, this is too much space to upload to the svn.
    You musf fill the next directories:
      pool/
      dist/
      indices/

      You can find all this stuff at http://mirror.isp.net.au/#ubuntu

  - Add to PATH the cdimage/bin dir
    PATH=$PATH:/home/pepito/cdimage/bin

  - Specify the CDIMAGE_ROOT var could be done in one of the next two ways:
   1. exporting it in the shell you will use
       $ export CDIMAGE_ROOT=/home/pepito/cdimage
   2. Changing in all files (under cdimage/bin/) the value of the variable.
   
  - Connection to internet, in one step of the process it will get various list of packages from internet.

  - Change "ArhiveDir" in flamenco.conf and d-i_flamenco.conf at cdimage/uda/conf/. "ArchiveDir" must point to the repository dir (cdimage/ftp).


The generation process
======================

  The script that do all the work is generate_no-live.sh'. This script call all the scripts under cdimage/bin/ in a logic order.
  So, execute:
  	$ generate_no-live.sh

  At cdimage/scratch/guadalinex/debian-cd/i386 it will be generated a .raw file, this is equivalent a .iso file.

Include packages
================

  To include a package, place the .deb or .udeb in cdimage/uda/pkgs, that's all!
  The package will be included in the pool if the package doesn't exist at pool/ or if this package is a newer version.
