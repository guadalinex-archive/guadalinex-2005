======================

  The script that do all the work is generate_no-live.sh'. This script call all the scripts under cdimage/bin/ in a logic order.
  So, execute:
  	$ generate_no-live.sh

  At cdimage/scratch/guadalinex/debian-cd/i386 it will be generated a .raw file, this is equivalent a .iso file.
