 <title>What is Ubuntu?</title>
<para>

Ubuntu is a complete desktop Linux operating system, freely available with
both community and professional support.  The Ubuntu community is built on
the ideas enshrined in the Ubuntu Manifesto: that software should be
available free of charge, that software tools should be usable by people in
their local language and despite any disabilities, and that people should
have the freedom to customize and alter their software in whatever way they
see fit.
