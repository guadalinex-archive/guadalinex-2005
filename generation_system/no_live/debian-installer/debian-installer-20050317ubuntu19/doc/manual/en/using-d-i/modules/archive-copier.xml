   <title>Copying Remaining Packages to the Hard Disk</title>

<para>

When installing from CD, after the base system has been installed, the
packages needed to install an Ubuntu desktop system are copied to the hard
disk. This allows the second stage of installation, after your computer has
rebooted, to proceed without you needing to insert the CD again.

On slower computers, this may take a long time. It can be disabled by
adding the boot parameter <userinput>archive-copier/copy=false</userinput>,
or by using expert mode, in which case <command>archive-copier</command>
will ask you if you want to copy the remaining packages to the hard disk. If
you disable the copying step, you will need to insert the CD again after
rebooting in order to install a full Ubuntu desktop.
