.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a program to help with the maintenance of large software distributions.
It takes a list of seed packages and a mirror of the distribution, and
produces outputs with the seed packages and their dependencies and
build-dependencies expanded out in full.
.Ss Seeds
The contents of the Ubuntu distribution, and others, are managed by means of
.Em seeds .
At their simplest, these are lists of packages which are considered
important to have in the main component of the distribution, without
explicitly listing all their dependencies and build-dependencies.
.Pp
Seed lists are typically divided up by category: a
.Li base
or
.Li minimal
seed might list the core set of packages required to make the system run at
all, while a
.Li desktop
seed might list the set of packages installed as part of a default desktop
installation.
.Nm
takes these seeds, adds their dependency trees, and produces an
.Em output
for each seed which contains a dependency-expanded list of package names.
These outputs may be handed on to archive maintenance or CD-building tools.
.Pp
Some seeds may
.Em inherit
from other seeds: they rely on those seeds to be installed.
For example, a
.Li desktop
seed will typically inherit from a
.Li minimal
seed.
.Nm
understands these inheritance relationships.
If a package in the
.Li desktop
seed depends on
.Sq foo ,
but
.Sq foo
is already part of the
.Li minimal
seed or dependency list, then
.Sq foo
will not be added to the
.Li desktop
output.
.Pp
Seeds are stored in text files downloaded from a given URL.
Lines not beginning with
.Sq "\ *\ "
(wiki-style list markup) are ignored.
A
.Pa STRUCTURE
file alongside the seeds lists their inheritance relationships.
.Ss Build-dependencies and Sq supported
There is typically no need for a default desktop installation to contain all
the compilers and development libraries needed to build itself from source;
if nothing else, it would consume much more space.
Nevertheless, it is normally a requirement for the maintainers of a
distribution to support all the packages necessary to build that
distribution.
.Pp
.Nm
therefore does not add all the packages that result from following
build-dependencies of seed packages and of their dependencies (the
.Dq build-dependency tree )
to every output, unless they are also in the seed or in the dependency list.
Instead, it adds them to the special
.Li supported
seed.
.Pp
Like any other seed, the supported seed may contain its own list of
packages.
It is common to provide support for many software packages which are not in
the default installation, such as debugging libraries, optimised kernels,
alternative language support, and the like.
.Ss Outputs
The output files are named after the seed to which they correspond.
An additional output file is needed for supported, namely
.Sq supported+build\-depends ,
which contains the supported list and the build-depends lists of the other
seeds all joined together.
An
.Sq all
output is produced to represent the entire archive.
.Pp
Some other files are produced for occasional use by experts.
See the
.Pa README
file for full details on these.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Xo Fl S ,
.Fl Fl seed\-source Ar source
.Xc
Fetch seeds from
.Ar source .
The default is
.Pa http://people.ubuntu.com/~cjwatson/seeds/ .
.It Xo Fl s ,
.Fl Fl seed\-dist Ar dist
.Xc
Fetch seeds for distribution
.Ar dist .
The default is
.Li breezy .
.It Xo Fl m ,
.Fl Fl mirror Ar mirror
.Xc
Get package lists from
.Ar mirror .
The default is
.Pa http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ .
.It Xo Fl d ,
.Fl Fl dist Ar dist Ns \&,...
.Xc
Operate on the specified distributions.
The default is
.Li breezy .
Listing multiple distributions may be useful, for example, when examining
both a released distribution and its security updates.
.It Xo Fl a ,
.Fl Fl arch Ar arch
.Xc
Operate on architecture
.Ar arch .
The default is
.Li i386 .
.It Xo Fl c ,
.Fl Fl components Ar component Ns \&,...
.Xc
Operate on the specified components.
The default is
.Li main .
.It Xo Fl i ,
.Fl Fl ipv6
.Xc
Check IPv6 status of source packages, using the statistics available at
.Pa http://debdev.fabbione.net/stat/ .
.It Fl Fl no\-rdepends
Disable reverse-dependency calculations.
These calculations cause a large number of small files to be written out in
the
.Pa rdepends/
directory, and may take some time.
.El
.Sh BUGS
The wiki-style markup in seeds was inherited from an early implementation,
and is a wart.
.Pp
.Nm
can sometimes be confused by complicated situations involving the order in
which it encounters dependencies on virtual packages.
Explicit entries in seeds may be required to work around this.
.Pp
Handling of installer packages (udebs) is complicated, poorly documented,
and doesn't always work quite right: in particular, packages aren't demoted
to the supported seed when they should be.
.Pp
The supported seed is more hard-coded than it should be.
