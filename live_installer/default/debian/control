Description: Ubuntu Live installer
 Live installers have featured itself until now by being very
 simple, friendly and graphical.
 .
 This Live Installer will be a simple one and well integrated with Debian and
 Ubuntu based systems.
 .
 Use Cases:
   * An user takes Ubuntu, he likes it and wants to install, as is, in his
 computer.
   * An user takes Ubuntu, he likes it, tests it, configures it and wants to have
 it installed, keeping the stored configuration, in his computer.
   * An user has tried Ubuntu, he knows that likes it and wants to install it,
 but neither wants nor needs to launch the complete distro (Desktop and so
 on). He just wants a fast and simple way to install.
   * An user has installed Ubuntu from Live version and wants to be able to have
 a configuration file with the chosen options, so in case he needs to reinstall
 or to install in a similar computer, just must get it.
