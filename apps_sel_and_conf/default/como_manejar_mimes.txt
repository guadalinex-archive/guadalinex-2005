This section will give you a small introduction which files need to be modified in order to change the system for your needs. Each of the shown files needs to be changed with root access.

-> /usr/share/applications/defaults.list
This file contains the applications which cause a double-click success. All Mime types will point to a desktop file.

-> /usr/share/applications/[application_name].desktop
This is the file where "defaults.list" will point to. One of the most important things inside this file is the entry "MimeType=".

-> /usr/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache
Contains information in similar form shown for file "defaults.list" in same directory. This file contains ALL associations given to a mime type. There is no need for a specified order of desktop files (see XMMS example lateron)

-> /usr/share/mime (Directory)
This directory contains several information. The sub-directories - excluding packages - contain information about given mime types. You'll see that many mime types already exist.
The packages directory contains the DATABASE calles freedesktop.org.xml!

-> /usr/share/mime/globs
This file contains the file extensions, associated to the mime-types.


Example: MPlayer should start WMV by Double-Click
I've uninstalled Xine and Totem, cause i only use MPlayer. After uninstalling them, i've seen the desaster: previously, Totem was the default player. And now there was ... nothing!
After two days of internet research, this essay was created ... so you havn't waste time as i have to do ;)

Creating the desktop file
If it is not already existing, create the file "/usr/share/applications/mplayer.desktop" like this:

[Desktop Entry]
Name=Movie Player
Comment=Play multimedia files and media
Icon=mplayer.xpm
Exec=gmplayer %f
Terminal=false
MimeType=video/mpeg;video/x-msvideo;video/quicktime;video/x-ms-asf;video/x-ms-wmv
Type=Application
Categories=Application;AudioVideo;
Encoding=UTF-8

The mime types for asf and wmv already exist and are stored in the mime type database (/usr/share/mime/packages/freedesktop.org.xml)

Modify defaults.list
This file will init our DEFAULT application. It ONLY contains ONE desktop file for EACH mime type:

video/x-ms-asf=mplayer.desktop
video/x-ms-wmv=mplayer.desktop


Modify mimeinfo.cache
To take effect as default application and init the double-click feature, we need to modify the mimeinfo.cache also:

video/x-ms-asf=mplayer.desktop
video/x-ms-wmv=mplayer.desktop

This file can use MORE then ONE desktop file. If you want to be able to handle - for example - WMV files with different players, a line like this is also acceptable:

video/x-ms-wmv=mplayer.desktop;realplay.desktop

This will change the right-click-menu and insert Helix-Player, while mplayer is still default (with double-click)

After modification, log out from gnome and log in again...
